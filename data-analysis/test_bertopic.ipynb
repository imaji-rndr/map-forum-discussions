I did end up finding a different control scheme that worked for my use case, but for the sake of the public repository of information: In a first person game, the mouse is hidden and typically doesn't act as a cursor while the player is looking around. Input hooks will capture relative mouse motion and use that to rotate the camera. What the mouse actually does doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't interfere with the aforementioned input or leave the window. Some behavior I've seen in the past includes the mouse jumping back to the center or other side of the window when you reach the edge or it simply hitting the edge like a wall and not being able to get out. This isn't something you typically observe directly, but the end result would be, for example, being able to continue moving your mouse in one direction indefinitely and the player's camera rotating in that direction without the mouse escaping the window.

It was not a straight line for me. At one point I didn\\'t want to continue developing software for others, and I went for a 3 month travel in Asia. After that I moved to Finland and started recording Processing video tutorials. I was able to do that because I was living with my grandma with almost no expenses. The tutorials eventually brought me opportunities to give workshops and teach in universities. For a long time I tried to experiment every day and post results online. Initially I did more work for other artists or design studios than for myself. I made money in various ways: teaching for groups or private lessons, workshops, mentoring, work for artists, for design studios, grants, art sales... The works involved sound programming, algorithmic visuals, interaction, Raspberry Pis and Arduinos, visual effects, shaders and live performances among others. The programming languages also were various: Processing, Java, C++, JavaScript, Kotlin, GLSL. Even if there was much variety, there was a direction: creative uses of technology using Free Open Source Software. I joined / started two creative coding communities in Berlin: the Sonic Code Sessions and Creative Code Berlin. I\\'m still part of the second one after more than 10 years. I find it valuable to meet twice per month and see what other people are creating and hear their stories. Paid projects have come sometimes through these communities. One challenge is sometimes motivation: I can find it hard to be creative while being aware of the challenges life in this planet is facing. Another challenge is thinking that new creations must be better than previous ones, or not allowing myself to play because creations should be worth exhibiting. Perfectionism. And more challenges: addiction to Internet. How often to share online? When? How to avoid getting lost scrolling? I try to avoid anything that is addictive. I could write a long post on all the things I have tried over the years :-) I think that those having a full time job doing software don\\'t always have energy for creative coding after work. On the other hand, it can also be hard to enjoy what used to be fun when it becomes a full-time job. This balance is tricky. At times I wished I had a regular part-time job somewhere with not so much thinking, maybe interacting with people, or somewhere where I could read or learn during work. A part-time job can also help. Health is another thing to pay attention to. Working with the computer can affect health at some point. It\\'s easy to get lost in the code and forget about our bodies. It\\'s important to avoid that. It works for a while, but not forever. I now switch between standing and sitting on a kneeling chair and use a split keyboard to have a better posture.

If you do `lunch` inside `extend`, it will use custom coroutine scope, which is strictly bound to rendering thread, so your code running there will be competing for execution time with the thread scheduling drawing operations on GPU through OpenGL abstraction. The proper way of establishing your WebSocket demon from within OPENRNDR would be to create new coroutine scope, and equivalent of `runBlocking` working on the main execution thread: ``` val dispatcher = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().asCoroutineDispatcher() launch(dispatcher){ // WebSocket handling code } ``` Communication between coroutines (WebSockect<->rendering thread) can be realized either through concurrent data structures, like @abe is suggesting, or through abstractions like `Flow` or `Channel` designed for this purpose.', ['\\nval dispatcher =  Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().asCoroutineDispatcher()\\nlaunch(dispatcher){\\n  // WebSocket handling code\\n}\\n'])",

          "('I am currently working on a stencil buffer to hold shape references 1,2,3... The idea is to draw a shape like a rect or circle with `drawer.isolatedWithRenderTarget(rt)` and draw the shapes at different z-values (maybe ?) of 1 or 2 each. On draw, the stencil buffer gets updated to now hold the unsigned integer reference of that shape. This would be the uniform input to a glsl filter, something like `uniform sampler2D stencil;`. There, I want to update each pixel based on that stencil value. I have only found `depthBuffer(format = DepthFormat.STENCIL8)`so far, but most access functions are private and this seems to be \"walled off\" from me. Any ideas on how to realize such a stencil buffer with write access ? 🤔 Kind regards, Lukas', [])",
          "(\"TL;DR: Is something similar to Processing's load/updatePixels functionality without a structure that requires declaring the default display as PImage/PGraphics available in OPENRNDR? I wonder this in part because of the line in the guide under Headless Applications that goes like this: > Headless applications cannot draw on the backbuffer, because there is no backbuffer. In order to draw you need to create a [RenderTarget](https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/renderTargets.html) and draw on there. Reading some source code mainly looking for a way to read pixel color values from the (assumed) backing colorbuffer to which a straight-forward sketch draws (not by user-defined render targets), I stumbled upon a few things: > interface ProgramRenderTarget > Driver.instance.activeRenderTarget I tried with activeRenderTarget but had no luck, for it carried no colorBuffers and throwed an index out of bounds error. And as to implementing something from the ProgramRenderTarget interface... Well, I'm kind of clueless. I don't know if a RenderTarget that wraps around the backbuffer is what I need, though it sounds really interesting and I'd really like to know more about it. Thanks for stopping by.\", [])",

          "(\"OPENRNDR programs are usually written against specific versions of the OR libraries. These versions are specified in the programs Gradle file (the de facto build tool for Kotlin). OR's releases are tagged in git (hosted on Github), so finding the source for a specific OR release is easy. We also maintain a [version matrix](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/wiki/Version-matrix) to keep track of internal library compatibilities. OR itself depends on libraries in the same way, with unambiguous library identifiers and version numbers. OR depends on libraries that are retrieved from the Maven Central repository. Maven Central appears to be reliable and to be around for a while. One of OR's development goals is to be very easy to build. Which means that you should be able to pull from our main branch and build it with either the Gradle CLI tooling or from the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. Manually chasing dependencies is absolutely out of the question as dependencies are pulled in from Maven Central. Now the unfortunate part: OR itself is not on Maven Central (yet) and the service that currently hosts our libraries (Bintray) announced they will abandon their service by May this year. We are working to publish all prior released libraries on Maven Central to provide the best in terms of longevity we realistically can. We strongly depend on LWJGL and JavaCPP and have no plans prepared to anticipate for a scenario in which either of the two would be abandoned. (I hope I don't jinx anything here). There is one big versioning hole in our documentation efforts though. Getting documentation that fits earlier versions of OR may be tricky. Happy to answer your questions and advice\", [])",
          "('# Word frequencies and using collections Hi! :slight_smile: I found one of the examples of Processing which analyzes two books ([Dracula and Frankenstein](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/tree/master/content/examples/Topics/Advanced%20Data/HashMapClass/data)), gets the word frequencies, then draws the words moving at different speeds and font sizes depending on those frequencies. It only shows words which appear more than 5 times in one of the books while not appearing at all in the other book. I like how this can be expressed in a concise way in Kotlin. *Note this is not a literal port of the Processing program to OPENRNDR, but more a reinterpretation with a similar output and simple code.* ![image|643x500](upload://h8SkjPrTh3EfVvgOC1zs6hl2Yf4.jpeg) ### Processing / Java The code is split in two files. I suggest opening them in new browser windows to see them side by side with the Kotlin code. https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/blob/master/content/examples/Topics/Advanced%20Data/HashMapClass/HashMapClass.pde https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/blob/master/content/examples/Topics/Advanced%20Data/HashMapClass/Word.pde ### OPENRNDR / Kotlin [details=\"Imports\"] ```Kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.draw.loadFont import org.openrndr.extra.noise.uniform import org.openrndr.math.Vector2 import org.openrndr.math.map import org.openrndr.shape.IntRectangle import java.io.File ``` [/details] ```kotlin fun main() = application { program { val fonts = List(10) { loadFont(\"data/fonts/SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf\", 4.0 + 5 * it) } // Make spawnArea tall so it\\'s not too crowded with words val spawnArea = Rectangle(-50.0, 0.0, width * 1.0, height * 3.0) // Render area is larger than the window so appearing objects don\\'t pop at the top // but start rendering above the edge and then slide in val renderArea = drawer.bounds.offsetEdges(30.0) class Word(val word: String, count: Int, val color: ColorRGBa) { // Pick initial random position inside spawnArea private var position = Vector2.uniform(spawnArea) // Calculate speed based on word count private var speed = Vector2( 0.0, count.toDouble().map(5.0, 25.0, 0.1, 5.0, true) ) // Pick font (size) based on word count private var font = fonts[count.toDouble().map( 5.0, 25.0, 0.0, fonts.size - 1.0, true ).toInt()] fun display() { // Move Word down position += speed // If too far down, bring back up if (position.y > spawnArea.height) { position -= Vector2(0.0, spawnArea.height) } // If `position` inside `renderArea`, draw it if (renderArea.contains(position)) { drawer.fill = color drawer.fontMap = font drawer.text(word, position) } } } // Create a `Map<String, Int>` with words and their counts val freqsDracula = File(\"data/texts/dracula.txt\") .readText().lowercase().split(Regex(\"\\\\\\\\W+\")) .groupingBy { it }.eachCount().filter { it.value >= 5 } val freqsFranken = File(\"data/texts/frankenstein.txt\") .readText().lowercase().split(Regex(\"\\\\\\\\W+\")) .groupingBy { it }.eachCount().filter { it.value >= 5 } // Make sure no words appear in both Maps. Unique words only. val uniqueDracula = freqsDracula - freqsFranken.keys val uniqueFranken = freqsFranken - freqsDracula.keys // Finally create a List<Word> to be displayed val words = uniqueDracula.map { (word, count) -> Word(word, count, ColorRGBa.WHITE) } + uniqueFranken.map { (word, count) -> Word(word, count, ColorRGBa.BLACK) } configure { width = 640 height = 360 } extend { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.GRAY) words.forEach { it.display() } } } } ``` Notice how I changed the approach making the `Word` class simpler. It has now just one method called `display()`. In the original example the `Word` class was used to keep various counts: how many times it appeared in book A, in book B, and in both together, with the goal of later filtering those words that appear 5 times or more only in one of the books but not in the other. Let\\'s take a look at how the Kotlin version works by jumping to the line that starts with `val freqsDracula =`. It reads like this: take a txt file, read its content, make it lower case, split (by white space) into words (likely repeated words), group by word, count words in each group, finally discard words with less than 5 repetitions. At this point we have one Map object per book linking `String` (the word) to `Int` (its count). Now, according to the original example, I want to remove words that are present in the other book, which I do just by subtracting the `keys` (words) from the other book. This gives me the words appearing 5 or more times in each book which never appear in the other book. In 4 lines of code. As a last step I transform our two Map of unique words into one list of `Word` objects which I called `words`. This way I don\\'t need to execute `qualify()` on each word to figure out if it is worth displaying: every item in `words` is displayable and it has a `speed`, a `color` and a font size pre-calculated. The original version calculates those three properties each time `move` or `display` are called. **Manipulating collections this way is one of my favorite aspects of Kotlin :-)** I hope you find it as concise and readable as I do. ### Text size and text centering One difference I want to point out is that one does not specify the text size when drawing text in OPENRNDR, the size is set when loading the font. Therefore I created an array of fonts with different sizes. An alternative would have been to call `drawer.scale()` to scale down the text and use just one font size. Another difference regarding text is that there\\'s isn\\'t a direct equivalent to Processing\\'s `textAlign` so the left edge of the `spawnArea` is at -50 to make sure the left margin of the window is not empty. ### About IDEs The Kotlin code in this page may be a bit harder to grasp than when inside a good IDE because the IDE shows type hints and tooltips describing what is under the mouse: ![image|690x176](upload://jNI1AOFv403Y2yqWefWQJNcdGak.png) *thick lines under type hints, thin orange line shows a tooltip for `freqsDracula`* :point_down: Share your questions and comments below . :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=%22Processing%22%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['Kotlin\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.draw.loadFont\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.noise.uniform\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\nimport org.openrndr.math.map\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.IntRectangle\\nimport java.io.File\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun main() = application {\\n    program {\\n        val fonts = List(10) {\\n            loadFont(\"data/fonts/SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf\", 4.0 + 5 * it)\\n        }\\n\\n        // Make spawnArea tall so it\\'s not too crowded with words\\n        val spawnArea = Rectangle(-50.0, 0.0, width * 1.0, height * 3.0)\\n\\n        // Render area is larger than the window so appearing objects don\\'t pop at the top\\n        // but start rendering above the edge and then slide in\\n        val renderArea = drawer.bounds.offsetEdges(30.0)\\n\\n        class Word(val word: String, count: Int, val color: ColorRGBa) {\\n            // Pick initial random position inside spawnArea\\n            private var position = Vector2.uniform(spawnArea)\\n\\n            // Calculate speed based on word count\\n            private var speed = Vector2(\\n                0.0, count.toDouble().map(5.0, 25.0, 0.1, 5.0, true)\\n            )\\n\\n            // Pick font (size) based on word count\\n            private var font = fonts[count.toDouble().map(\\n                5.0, 25.0, 0.0, fonts.size - 1.0, true\\n            ).toInt()]\\n\\n            fun display() {\\n                // Move Word down\\n                position += speed\\n\\n                // If too far down, bring back up\\n                if (position.y > spawnArea.height) {\\n                    position -= Vector2(0.0, spawnArea.height)\\n                }\\n\\n                // If `position` inside `renderArea`, draw it\\n                if (renderArea.contains(position)) {\\n                    drawer.fill = color\\n                    drawer.fontMap = font\\n                    drawer.text(word, position)\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // Create a `Map<String, Int>` with words and their counts\\n        val freqsDracula = File(\"data/texts/dracula.txt\")\\n            .readText().lowercase().split(Regex(\"\\\\\\\\W+\"))\\n            .groupingBy { it }.eachCount().filter { it.value >= 5 }\\n\\n        val freqsFranken = File(\"data/texts/frankenstein.txt\")\\n            .readText().lowercase().split(Regex(\"\\\\\\\\W+\"))\\n            .groupingBy { it }.eachCount().filter { it.value >= 5 }\\n\\n        // Make sure no words appear in both Maps.

People can use the one that they prefer, but I very strongly feel that infix usage should at least be permitted. Personally I like the infix options as they make more sense to me as that's how you write them out in set theory when doing math on paper. I strongly prefer infix operations (and usage of +, -, etc) in vectors for similar reasons. In fact, being able to write vectors like we do in math is one of the reasons I like OPRNDR so much. It's much easier to read, esp. if you're maybe referencing actual math material. Funnily enough, this reminded me of back when I was first learning Kotlin (in around 2013-2014). I was kinda learning Kotlin on the side at the same time we where learning set theory at university, so I played around with implementing sets in Kotlin. I went really far in making in look like math, because I wanted something that looked like the union character we use in actual math: `let a = b ∪ c`, so I set up an infix for just the letter `u` so I could write: `val a = b u c`. I think that's going way to far though, but just writing union in-between reads fairly well to me anyway, that is: `val a = b union c`.\", [])",

Programming in the Processing IDE: launches very fast and lets you iterate with your experiments quickly but limited to older versions of Java. 2. Using Processing in a more advanced IDE: allows you to use new versions of Java with simplified and more expressive syntax (for example streams, var, lambdas, etc.). Such IDEs make life easier when programs grow to several code files. 3. Programming [Processing using Kotlin](https://discourse.processing.org/t/writing-processing-in-kotlin/3957): a language that still compiles to Java bytecode, but less verbose.

The reason I chose B is because I find it less confusing when mapping the looped variable. For example, if I wanted to map the previous ranges to the range (100.0, 400.0), I would use * `map(0.0, 9.0, 100.0, 400.0, x * 1.0)` In case A, we have 10 in the loop but 9.0 in the map (because we count from 0 up to - but not including - 10). In cases B and C we have 9 both in the loop and in the map, which I think helps avoid errors.

This means generating values which are frame dependent or smoothing out noisy data. Included since ORX [0.3.51](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/releases/tag/v0.3.51) ## Time Operators Time Operators is in itself an Extension which provides an interface to develop in sync tools. It can be used like so: ```kotlin extend(TimeOperators()) { track(envelope, lfo) } ``` [ A look at Time Operators under the hood](#a-look-at-time-operators-under-the-hood) ## Envelope [Envelope](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/blob/master/orx-time-operators/src/main/kotlin/Envelope.kt) is an Attack/Decay based envelope which takes into account the elapsed time to change a given value over time. Here are two examples where you can see the benefit of the Envelope in action. We start with a random set of values for the square\\'s size and we move to shape them to a set of smooth curves, including passing through a scenario where the values are held for a longer time. https://vimeo.com/421881218 https://vimeo.com/421881491 ### Usage This how you would use an Envelope starting with it\\'s function signature. ```kotlin Envelope( restValue: Double = 0.0 targetValue: Double = 1.0 attack: Double = 0.3 decay: Double = 0.5 easingFactor: Double = 0.3 reTrigger: Boolean = false ) ``` * `restValue` : The value which the envelope gravitates to when approaching the resting phase * `targetValue` : The target value which the envelope approaches when it\\'s triggered * `attack` : The attack duration, how long after being triggered it will take to reach the target value * `decay` : The decay duration, how long after it reached the target value it will take to reach the resting value * `easingFactor` : A value between [0.0, 1.0] which allows shaping the curvature of the attack and decay phases * `reTrigger`: Forces the envelope to start from the `restValue` when it\\'s triggered during an ongoing attack/decay cycle #### Trimmed down code example: ```kotlin val size = Envelope(50.0, attack = 1.5, decay = 1.0) extend(TimeOperators()) { track(size) } extend { // you can pass a new target value when triggering it if (frameCount % 120 == 0) size.trigger(Random.double(50.0, 350.0)) drawer.circle(0.0, 0.0, size.value) } ``` ## LFO In the following video you can see the LFO in action. The essence of the animation is sampling the same LFO at different phases, done like so: ```kotlin val droppedChars = lfo.sample(1.0, i / 8.0) * 8 val text = \"OPENRNDR\".dropLast(droppedChars.toInt()) ``` https://vimeo.com/419288928 ### Usage It\\'s important to mention that the LFO always outputs values between [0.0, 1.0]. This how you would use a LFO starting with it\\'s function signature. ```kotlin LFO( wave: LFOWave = LFOWave.Saw ) ``` * `wave` : The type of wave to be used #### Available waves: ```kotlin enum class LFOWave { Saw, Sine, Square, Triangle } ``` The LFO can either be used by calling a method after a wave\\'s name or through `sample`, which relies on the set wave type via `lfo.wave`: ```kotlin lfo.saw() // or lfo.sample() ``` #### Trimmed down code example: ```kotlin val lfo = LFO() extend(TimeOperators()) { track(lfo) } extend { // you can pass a new target value when triggering it if (frameCount % 120 == 0) size.trigger(350.0) drawer.circle(0.0, 0.0, 40.0 + lfo.sine() * 20.0) } ``` ## A look at Time Operators under the hood Underneath it simply makes sure that before each draw loop the time operators are being **ticked**, allowing them to advance in time. The interface of the ticking function is the following: ```kotlin interface TimeTools { fun tick(seconds: Double, deltaTime: Double, frameCount: Int) } ``` This simple interface also allows the operators to move forward in time without activating the `TimeOperators` extension via `extend(TimeOperators())`.

The shader then copies to every pixel on the screen the color of a pixel somewhere above or below, the exact source location defined by the value of `p_time`. :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=Processing%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['\\nPImage img;\\nvoid setup() {\\n  size(1280, 640, P2D);\\n  img = loadImage(\"/path/to/your/photo.jpg\");\\n  img.loadPixels();\\n}\\nvoid draw() {\\n  int yy = frameCount % img.height;\\n  for(int x=0; x<width; x++) {\\n    int xx = (int)map(x, 0, width, 0, img.width);\\n    stroke(img.pixels[xx + yy * img.width]);\\n    line(x, 0, x, height);\\n  }\\n}\\nvoid keyPressed() {\\n  if(key == \\'s\\') {\\n    save(\"thumb.jpg\");\\n  }\\n}\\n', '\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure {\\n        width = 1280\\n        height = 640\\n    }\\n    program {\\n        val img = loadImage(\"/path/to/your/photo.jpg\")\\n        val shadow = img.shadow\\n        shadow.download()\\n        extend(Screenshots())\\n        extend {\\n            val yy = frameCount % img.height\\n            for (x in 0 until width) {\\n                val xx = map(0.0, width.toDouble(), 0.0, img.width.toDouble(), x.toDouble()).toInt()\\n                drawer.stroke = shadow[xx, yy]\\n                drawer.lineSegment(x.toDouble(), 0.0, x.toDouble(), height.toDouble())\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', '\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure {\\n        width = 1280\\n        height = 640\\n    }\\n    program {\\n        val img = loadImage(\"/path/to/your/photo.jpg\")\\n        extend(Screenshots())\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.shadeStyle = shadeStyle {\\n                fragmentTransform = \"x_fill = texture(p_img, vec2(c_boundsPosition.x, fract(p_time)));\"\\n                parameter(\"img\", img)\\n                parameter(\"time\", seconds * 0.05)\\n            }\\n            drawer.rectangle(drawer.bounds)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",

The intention becomes clearer and the grid is now defined by 4 values instead of 14 (depending on how you count). * `Random.simplex()` now accepts `Vector2` and `Vector3` arguments. Both can be multiplied by a scalar, making the call to `simplex` a bit shorter (if you don\\'t care about scaling x and y differently). * I made the circle sizes proportional to the cell width. That way I can easily adjust column and row counts on the grid and have non-overlapping circles. Here with 32 x 12: ![image|690x343](upload://h1EeixbxbQet86YKUgbsqBYFdlg.jpeg) * In some cases I would use `colors.random()` instead of `Random.pick(colors)` but the first one is not seeded and the second one is. In this case we want it seeded to avoid having the colors change on every animation frame.

Though this could be fixed pretty easily by splitting the bricks vertically, clipping the top bricks once, and not clipping the bottom bricks that have to be recolored each frame.\", [])",

          "(\"Hi! Nice idea to use websockets :) The errors you describe sound like threading issues to me. If ktor runs in a loop then it doesn't get to the extend loop. Or the other way around. I think ktor should run in a separate thread (so it starts and runs there independently of the OPENRNDR program), but not sure how. When it does run in a separate thread, then one also needs to be careful because nothing should be drawn triggered by events that are not coming from the default graphics thread. I think it would crash. [This example plays a midi file](https://github.com/hamoid/openrndr-template/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/apps2022/loadMidiFile.kt). The player runs in its own thread (which it creates automatically, I didn't do that). The interesting thing is that I use a `ConcurrentHashMap` to make sure the external event doesn't try to use OPENGL directly. The external event updates that hash map, then I read that hash map from `extend`. I think receiving websocket events and midi file events may require a similar approach. [This orx also uses ktor](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/blob/master/orx-jvm/orx-rabbit-control/src/main/kotlin/RabbitControlServer.kt). Does it give you any ideas?

I'm not sure how that translates exactly to an environment without an HTML containing the sketches. If your goal is to render multiple canvases, and maybe export some of them to disk as an image, you can do that with render targets: https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/renderTargets.html A render target contains a [color buffer](https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/colorbuffers.html), which you can save to disk. If what you want is to have two full programs with their unique `extends {}` block in the same window running side by side, that requires a bit more thinking. There is an OPENRNDR extension that allows running multiple programs side by side, but it's not yet public. It's available if you [build orx locally](https://github.com/openrndr/orx#publish-and-use-local-builds-of-the-library-in-your-applications).

All fine, until you realize that a closed curve cannot have a single continuous coordinate, since you have to identify the value 0.0 and 1.0 (mathematicians would say that you <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(topology)\">cannot cover a closed simple curve with a single chart</a> ). This problem is solved in the fragment shader with a little bit of \"step function acrobatics\" to avoid branching, and to have a nice gradient. I think the shader can be further optimized but I am kinda happy with the result. A next step would be to make use of the alpha channel, this should simplify the mixing part. I have also added a self-made bloom effect: if you move the mouse to the far right you can see how taxing the double gaussian blur pass really is.', ['kotlin\\n    import org.openrndr.KEY_ENTER\\n    import org.openrndr.application\\n    import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\n    import org.openrndr.draw.*\\n    import org.openrndr.extra.fx.blur.GaussianBlur\\n    import org.openrndr.extra.noise.uniform\\n    import org.openrndr.extra.videoprofiles.gif\\n    import org.openrndr.ffmpeg.ScreenRecorder\\n    import org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\n    import org.openrndr.math.chaikinSmooth\\n    import org.openrndr.shape.contour\\n    import kotlin.math.*\\n    \\n    \\n    fun main() = application {\\n        configure {\\n            width = 1000\\n            height = 1000\\n        }\\n    \\n        program {\\n            var t = 0.0\\n           \\n            val rt = renderTarget(width, height){\\n                colorBuffer()\\n                depthBuffer()\\n            }\\n    \\n            val rtBright = renderTarget(width, height){\\n                colorBuffer()\\n                depthBuffer()\\n            }\\n    \\n            val img = colorBuffer(width, height)\\n    \\n            val blur = GaussianBlur()\\n    \\n    \\n            val nVerts = 3\\n            val rad = 80.0\\n            val scl = 0.2\\n            val nContours = 20\\n    \\n            val pnts = List(nVerts) {\\n                val offset = Double.uniform(rad - 20.0, rad + 20.0)\\n                val x = (rad + offset) * cos(it * 2.0/nVerts * PI)\\n                val y = (rad + offset) * sin(it * 2.0/nVerts * PI)\\n                Vector2(x, y)\\n            }\\n    \\n            val points = chaikinSmooth(pnts, 10, true)\\n    \\n            val contours = List(nContours) {\\n                contour {\\n                    moveTo(points[0] * (1.0 + scl * it ))\\n                    for (i in 1 until points.size) {\\n                        lineTo(points[i] * (1.0 + scl * it ))\\n                    }\\n                    lineTo(points[0] * (1.0 + scl * it ))\\n    \\n                }\\n            }\\n\\n            val speeds = contours.map{Double.uniform(0.1, 0.4)}     \\n\\n            var backCol = ColorRGBa.fromHex(\"#232323\")\\n    \\n            extend(ScreenRecorder()) {\\n                gif()\\n            }\\n            extend {\\n    \\n                drawer.fill = null\\n                drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE\\n                drawer.strokeWeight = 4.0\\n    \\n    \\n                drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt) {\\n                    drawer.clear(backCol)\\n                    contours.forEachIndexed { id, c ->\\n                        drawer.shadeStyle = shadeStyle {\\n                            fragmentTransform = \"\"\" \\n                        // Normalize the curve coordinate between 0.0 and 1.0;\\n                        float t = c_contourPosition/p_l;\\n                        // Define starting and ending point, namely b and a;\\n                        float a = mod(p_t, 1.0);\\n                        float b = mod(p_t + p_d, 1.0);\\n                        // Create a \"step function\" which is 1.0 if a < t < b, and 0.0 otherwise;\\n                        // Notice that if a > b we have to change the condition since the coordinate t will jump when crossing the origin\\n                        float d = step(a, b ) * step(a, t) * step(t, b) + step(b, a) * (1.0 - step(b, t) * step(t, a));\\n                        // Make a gradient going from the background color to white;\\n                        vec3 br = mix(p_backCol.xyz, vec3(1.0), d);\\n                        // Compute the mixing coefficient for the color gradient, normalized to (0.0, 1.0), and taking into account when 0 is included in the \\n                        // moving window;

          "(\"> 2. Logically `union` is basically same as ‘+’, so it makes sense to use the two in a similar way Sorry to nitpick, but + does have meanings with collections that is quite different from union in Kotlin. Using + between ordered collections like lists is concatenation (like with strings), so the order very much matters. This really matters, because you can do *Set operations* on collections that aren't strictly speaking sets. Consider the following: ``` val a = listOf(1, 2, 3) val b = listOf(2, 3, 4) val x = a union b // [1, 2, 3, 4] val y = b union a // [1, 2, 3, 4] val z = a + b // [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4] val w = b + a // [2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3] ``` Again, sorry to nitpick, I just think stuff like this can cause confusion if we aren't clear about it.

          "('When we launch the Processing 4 IDE a dialog welcomes us letting us choose between a few example programs. One those programs is the iconic RotatingArcs from [Marius Watz](https://linktr.ee/mariuswatz). ![Rendered with the OPENRNDR version listed below|666x500](upload://bQRP4CIPb2W0Lc1JRwoXoQRH9iu.png) As far as I could tell, the original program was added to the Processing repository on [Monday May 28th, 2007](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/71b23ecc19b8aa40979e932442d41fe32193ba3e/web/content/examples/3D%20and%20OpenGL/OpenGL/Geometry/Geometry.pde), at a time when computer displays were either 800x600 or 1024x768. I think code written in Java at the time often looked a bit like C, maybe because developers had experience in that language or as a way to optimize it. If the program was written today it would look quite different, so please don\\'t assume this is how modern Java code looks like. The reason I ported this program is that I felt inspired by these visuals which I\\'ve seen for so many years, and I wanted to figure out how I would approach this in Kotlin and OPENRNDR, specially the 3D drawing aspect. ### Processing / Java This is the program as included in Processing today. It no longer uses sine and cosine lookup tables. https://github.com/processing/processing-examples/blob/main/Demos/Graphics/RotatingArcs/RotatingArcs.pde The aspect that stands out most to me it\\'s the use of `index` to place data in an array where different properties have no names, but just a position in the array. This reminds me of old times, when you needed to know the index and type of each piece of data in a larger blob. It may be efficient for the computer, but harder to decode for the human. Instead of trying to port the program line by line I decided to produce the same visuals but thinking from the ground up how to achieve that. Initially I created a `data class` called `StyledRing` but it eventually grew to be a proper class with a `draw` method. The class configures itself randomly, following the original program. It sets random rotations, radius, speed, etc. It now also has a `style`, which controls what type of ring it is: one with long, THIN strips, one with repeated QUADS or a solid THICK ring. The core difference is how the rendering happens. In Processing you can call `vertex()` to add vertices one by one to the scene. This is done on every animation frame. In the OPENRNDR version I constructed vertex buffers only once when the program starts. After that the only thing that changes is the rotations used for the rings. The vertices stay in the GPU and are drawn by calling `drawer.vertexBuffer()`. This would be equivalent to creating `PShape` instances in Processing. We don\\'t currently have `DrawPrimitive.QUADS` in OPENRNDR so I draw two triangles instead. ### OPENRNDR / Kotlin [details=\"imports\"] ```kotlin import org.openrndr.WindowMultisample import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.color.rgb import org.openrndr.draw.* import org.openrndr.extra.camera.OrbitalCamera import org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random import org.openrndr.math.Polar import org.openrndr.math.Vector3 ``` [/details] ```kotlin enum class Style { THIN, QUADS, THICK } class StyledRing(val color: ColorRGBa) { private var xRotation = Random.double0(360.0) private var yRotation = Random.double0(360.0) private val radius = Random.int(2, 50) * 5 private val speed = Random.double(0.1, 0.6) private val style = Style.values().random() private val degrees = if (Random.bool(0.9)) Random.int(60, 80) else Random.int(8, 27) * 10 private val width = if (Random.bool(0.9)) Random.int(4, 32) else Random.int(40, 60) private val format = vertexFormat { position(3) } private val vertexBuffers = mutableListOf<VertexBuffer>() private val primitive: DrawPrimitive private fun polar(angle: Int, radius: Int) = Polar(angle.toDouble(), radius.toDouble()).cartesian.xy0 init { when (style) { Style.THIN -> { repeat(width / 2) { val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 1 * degrees) val rad = radius + it * 2 geo.put { repeat(degrees) { angle -> write(polar(angle, rad)) } } vertexBuffers.add(geo) } primitive = DrawPrimitive.LINE_STRIP } Style.QUADS -> { val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 6 * degrees / 4) geo.put { repeat(degrees / 4) { var angle = it * 4 val a = polar(angle, radius) val b = polar(angle, radius + width) angle += 2 val c = polar(angle, radius + width) val d = polar(angle, radius) write(a, b, c, a, c, d) } } vertexBuffers.add(geo) primitive = DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLES } Style.THICK -> { val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 2 * degrees) geo.put { repeat(degrees) { angle -> write( polar(angle, radius), polar(angle, radius + width) ) } } vertexBuffers.add(geo) primitive = DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLE_STRIP } } } fun draw(drawer: Drawer) { drawer.isolated { drawer.rotate(Vector3.UNIT_X, xRotation) drawer.rotate(Vector3.UNIT_Y, yRotation) drawer.fill = color vertexBuffers.forEach { drawer.vertexBuffer(it, primitive) } xRotation += speed yRotation += speed / 2 } } } ``` The main method is rather simple: it just sets up a collection of `StyleRing` and calls the `.draw()` method of each instance on every animation frame. I set multisampling to make the lines look nicer. I didn\\'t implement my own color mixing but just used the `.mix()` method. There\\'s a 3D `OrbitalCamera`. ```kotlin fun main() = application { configure { width = 1024 height = 768 multisample = WindowMultisample.SampleCount(8) } program { val palette = listOf( rgb(\"C8FF00D2\"), rgb(\"327800D2\"), rgb(\"FF6400D2\"), rgb(\"FFFF00D2\"), rgb(\"FFFFFFDC\") ) val rings = List(150) { StyledRing( when (Random.int0(100)) { in 0..50 -> palette[0].mix(palette[1], Random.double0()) in 51..90 -> palette[2].mix(palette[3], Random.double0()) else -> palette[4] } ) } extend(OrbitalCamera(Vector3.UNIT_Z * 400.0, Vector3.ZERO)) { rotate(30.0, 30.0) } extend { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) rings.forEach { it.draw(drawer) } } } } ``` Even if we do have a `Polar` class, I created a `polar()` method to accept integers, convert to Cartesian and return a Vector3. Normally I would just work with Double, but it made porting this specific program a bit shorter. Something you might be wondering about is, why didn\\'t I just use `ShapeContour` to draw curves? The reason is that the 2D drawing methods in OPENRNDR are not designed to deal with depth, occlusion and transparency in 3D. That\\'s why I used [vertex buffers](https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/customRendering.html#vertex-buffers). Another detail to note: `vertexBuffers` is a `mutableList` because the THIN ring style includes multiple line strips and you can not store multiple line strips in one vertex buffer. Or... actually you could by setting `vertexOfset` and `vertexCount` in `drawer.vertexBuffer`, but that might be harder for you to read. A `mutableList` would not be necessary to draw QUADS (out of triangles) or THICK (a triangle strip), as in these cases the vertex data can be stored contiguously in just one vertex buffer. But that\\'s the approach I came up with. If you have ideas for a different design I\\'m all ears. I\\'ll be happy to read what you think about the Kotlin version :) :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=Processing%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['kotlin\\nimport org.openrndr.WindowMultisample\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.color.rgb\\nimport org.openrndr.draw.*\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.camera.OrbitalCamera\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Polar\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector3\\n', 'kotlin\\nenum class Style { THIN, QUADS, THICK }\\n\\nclass StyledRing(val color: ColorRGBa) {\\n    private var xRotation = Random.double0(360.0)\\n    private var yRotation = Random.double0(360.0)\\n    private val radius = Random.int(2, 50) * 5\\n    private val speed = Random.double(0.1, 0.6)\\n    private val style = Style.values().random()\\n    private val degrees = if (Random.bool(0.9))\\n        Random.int(60, 80) else Random.int(8, 27) * 10\\n    private val width = if (Random.bool(0.9))\\n        Random.int(4, 32) else Random.int(40, 60)\\n\\n    private val format = vertexFormat { position(3) }\\n    private val vertexBuffers = mutableListOf<VertexBuffer>()\\n    private val primitive: DrawPrimitive\\n\\n    private fun polar(angle: Int, radius: Int) =\\n        Polar(angle.toDouble(), radius.toDouble()).cartesian.xy0\\n\\n    init {\\n        when (style) {\\n            Style.THIN -> {\\n                repeat(width / 2) {\\n                    val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 1 * degrees)\\n                    val rad = radius + it * 2\\n                    geo.put {\\n                        repeat(degrees) { angle -> write(polar(angle, rad)) }\\n                    }\\n                    vertexBuffers.add(geo)\\n                }\\n                primitive = DrawPrimitive.LINE_STRIP\\n            }\\n\\n            Style.QUADS -> {\\n                val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 6 * degrees / 4)\\n                geo.put {\\n                    repeat(degrees / 4) {\\n                        var angle = it * 4\\n                        val a = polar(angle, radius)\\n                        val b = polar(angle, radius + width)\\n\\n                        angle += 2\\n                        val c = polar(angle, radius + width)\\n                        val d = polar(angle, radius)\\n\\n                        write(a, b, c, a, c, d)\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                vertexBuffers.add(geo)\\n                primitive = DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLES\\n            }\\n\\n            Style.THICK -> {\\n                val geo = vertexBuffer(format, 2 * degrees)\\n                geo.put {\\n                    repeat(degrees) { angle ->\\n                        write(\\n                            polar(angle, radius),\\n                            polar(angle, radius + width)\\n                        )\\n                    }\\n                }\\n                vertexBuffers.add(geo)\\n                primitive = DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLE_STRIP\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    fun draw(drawer: Drawer) {\\n        drawer.isolated {\\n            drawer.rotate(Vector3.UNIT_X, xRotation)\\n            drawer.rotate(Vector3.UNIT_Y, yRotation)\\n            drawer.fill = color\\n            vertexBuffers.forEach { drawer.vertexBuffer(it, primitive) }\\n            xRotation += speed\\n            yRotation += speed / 2\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure {\\n        width = 1024\\n        height = 768\\n        multisample = WindowMultisample.SampleCount(8)\\n    }\\n\\n    program {\\n        val palette = listOf(\\n            rgb(\"C8FF00D2\"), rgb(\"327800D2\"),\\n            rgb(\"FF6400D2\"), rgb(\"FFFF00D2\"),\\n            rgb(\"FFFFFFDC\")\\n        )\\n        val rings = List(150) {\\n            StyledRing(\\n                when (Random.int0(100)) {\\n                    in 0..50 -> palette[0].mix(palette[1], Random.double0())\\n                    in 51..90 -> palette[2].mix(palette[3], Random.double0())\\n                    else -> palette[4]\\n                }\\n            )\\n        }\\n        extend(OrbitalCamera(Vector3.UNIT_Z * 400.0, Vector3.ZERO)) {\\n            rotate(30.0, 30.0)\\n        }\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK)\\n            rings.forEach { it.draw(drawer) }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",
          "(\"Hey, I've played around with various creative coding frameworks (Processing, openFrameworks, ++) and OpenRNDR really looks interesting! Anyway, for some stuff I really like to program in an OOP style with the objects drawing themselves (I picked up this habit in [The Nature of Code book](https://natureofcode.com). In both Processing and openFrameworks the drawing functions are always available as “global” functions (I know Processing does some trickery behind the scenes here), yet in OpenRNDR this seems to not be the case (I'm sure for good reasons). I just curious about what would be “good” style for doing this kind of programming in OpenRNDR? My current approach is to just have my objects have a reference to the program object like so: class Ball(val program: Program) { val radius = 25.0 var position = Vector2(program.width/2.0, program.height/2.0) var velocity = Vector2.uniform(-5.0, 5.5) fun iterate() { with (program) { position += velocity if (position.x + radius > width || position.x - radius < 0) { velocity = velocity.reflect(Vector2.UNIT_X) } if (position.y + radius > height || position.y - radius < 0) { velocity = velocity.reflect(Vector2.UNIT_Y) } drawer.circle(position, radius) } } } fun main() = application { program { val balls = (1..15).map { Ball(this) } extend { for (b in balls) b.iterate() } } } Is this a reasonable way to structure these OOP oriented programs? Or is there a smarter/easier/more convenient way to do this that I don't know of? I've never really programmed much of Kotlin so I'm not that familiar with the idioms. Otherwise I want to say that OpenRNDR seems like a really cool creative coding framework. Seem to strike a good balance between convenience, simplicity and flexibility. I've tried many of the frameworks, but usually one or more of the following frustrate me: can't get external libraries to work, very ”heavy” to get started on a simple idea, struggling with cross platform, frustrating IDE (lack of autocomplete!). So I'm looking forward to looking more into OpenRNDR. I also want mention Aren Davey who did a really good job of explaining where OpenRNDR fits in the creative coding landscape in [this video](https://youtu.be/eZ6qR-1zPbY). That's what inspired me to give it a go.\", [])",

[This repository](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-intellij-settings) includes a collection of them fine tuned for OPENRNDR. [Install instructions here](https://openrndr.discourse.group/t/using-live-templates-to-type-less/348/2). Example: type `ora[TAB]` and it gets expanded into ``` fun main() = application { configure { } program { extend { } } } ``` So convenient! Just create a new Kotlin file, type `ora`, press the `TAB` key and you're rolling :slight_smile: You can combine them with your own live templates. My settings look like this: ![image|268x500](upload://6q57lRMncWTd9NdzPpLxYMMyyjy.png) I added things I frequently use, for example `kb` expands into: ``` keyboard.keyDown.listen { when(it.key) { KEY_ENTER -> 1+1 KEY_ESCAPE -> application.exit() } } ``` Do you have any templates that make your life easier?\", ['\\nfun main() = application { \\n    configure { }\\n    program {\\n        extend {\\n            \\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', '\\nkeyboard.keyDown.listen { \\n    when(it.key) {\\n        KEY_ENTER -> 1+1\\n        KEY_ESCAPE -> application.exit()\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",

          "('Hello, I\\'ve been playing around with the new live coding version of OPENRNDR with oliveProgram as shown in Edwin\\'s great introduction talk over at github. I like the logic behind this, enabling layers and the ease of postFX with shaders. Two questions - is there any documentation about the available shaders that can be applied and is there a good way in which one can extend classes for incorporating one\\'s own shaders? Secondly, I\\'ve encountered a troublesome crash lately using Olive. My computer freezes and the mouse pad locks suddenly. No solution but to reboot. This problem I noticed occurred after automating the offset values for the Perturb fx. This is the line : ``` post(Perturb()) { phase = simplex(0, seconds * 0.10) * 0.75 + 0.10 offset = Vector2(0.0, simplex(0, seconds * 0.05) * 0.75) }.addTo(gui) ``` My program uses a font import and follows the basic structure that Edwin showed in his video, manipulating layers with different post FX. I\\'m working with a MacBook Pro Retina 13inch (2015) running the latest version of Catalina.

I wonder how to make the guide multi-language and specially how to keep it in sync when the English version is later updated. The source code for the guide is at [here](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-guide/tree/dev/src/main/kotlin/docs). A simple approach would be to fork the whole project, but that would not be good later to track changes. Another option would be that each source file contains all languages, which may work when having just 2 or 3 languages, but with more it might get complicated. Maybe a first step is to figure out what is the workflow for multi-language guides in other frameworks. These days it should be much easier to translate content using [deepl](https://deepl.com) for example, at least as a rough version so no need to type every single word from scratch :)\", [])",

The system has a tool bar and the different tools allow drawing and modifying shapes in different ways. He plans to release it eventually after further testing and cleaning up the code.

          "(\"Hi everyone! A colleague of mine sent me the RNDR studio website cause she suspected I'd like the works, and it turns out I've fell into the Open RNDR rabbit hole from there. I go by @Neurotypique pretty much everywhere so I if we've crossed paths on Instagram for instance :wave:. I come from graphic design and art direction, climbed my way into code through Touchdesigner, pico-8 and processing / P5.js, so I wasn't aware of any other frameworks or languages besides the really popular ones.

I tried that in processing with a UI that could change palette, load image, put title and text in the right font, export png, svg and mp4 but exporting into an app proved difficult and inconsistent across platforms. I hope to become a little more aware of what I'm actually doing with OpenRNDR and Kotlin, Processing is frustrating for me because I know that outside this little protected garden my knowledge ins't transferrable. My second goal is to be able to build VJing and audiovisual interractive apps/experiences like I do in TouchDesigner, using CV (control voltage generated by modular synthesizers), MIDI and OSC; and have the result shareable with a friend, client, another of my devices. Touchdesigner is awesome but not being able to export (not render) is a shame for some use cases.

          "('[GitHub link to code for those who just want to see that.](https://github.com/torb-xyz/phidgets-in-openrndr/) When making interactive installations getting hardware input from things like potentiometers, various sensors (like light or temperature) or outputting to something like a LED light, relay or motor can be quite interesting. I’m sure a lot of us has done this with something like Arduino, but personally I’ve found it a bit annoying to work with (tho workable). Some years ago I discovered [Phidgets](https://phidgets.com/docs/What_is_a_Phidget%3F). The name is a riff on the 90s word for GUI components: ‘widgets’ and ‘physical’. This is a complete system including hardware, software and API for many different languages and operating systems that allows you to interact with sensors, actuators, RFID readers/writers and other hardware. ![262E3CEE-93B2-4240-BFB9-DFE4800C8683|600x155, 75%](upload://3mj8ZLEAJYFpJNwmGqqm260P0o7.jpeg) To me Phidgets seem to be a bit of a hidden gem in the world of getting non-typical I/O to a computer so I’d thought I’d make a short guide on how to use them here. Note: I’m not affiliated with Phidgets, I just like their stuff. One of the platforms Phidgets support is the JVM and the excellent integration Kotlin has with Java makes it very ergonomic to use and program (especially with OPENRNDR). ## Hardware Obviously, to follow along you need to have some hardware from Phidgets. I recommend getting the [VINT Hub](https://www.phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=2&pcid=1&prodid=643) and some components like a [rotary](https://phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=103&pcid=83&prodid=87) or [linear](https://www.phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=12&pcid=10&prodid=83) potentiometer or maybe another kind of analog sensor like a [distance sensor](https://phidgets.com/?tier=3&catid=5&pcid=3&prodid=1148) or anything else that you find interesting. Don’t forget order cables to connect things together! ## Setup and installation Assuming you have some Phidget hardware, to get started you need to install the [drivers](https://phidgets.com/docs/Phidgets_Drivers). _After_ you’ve installed the drivers connect your Phidget hardware. For our example here I’m using a VINT Hub and a rotary potentiometer but feel free to use something else. ![70095B96-3DFD-40AD-8B03-D92E24DEEF30|666x500, 75%](upload://3Xn3G61by8ffqmivFt8WmCL8jmq.jpeg) After you’ve connected your Phidget, open the Phidget Control Panel that’s included with the drivers. The Control Panel is a very useful tool to debug your Phidget hardware and figure out how to program it. *Important gotcha:* Phidget doesn’t allow more than one program connected to a Phidget at the same time, so make sure to close down Phidget Control Panel before your run your own programs! ![015EEB80-3305-4ADE-9D9D-EADFA1421D96|600x287, 75%](upload://1K6KEqVdalx980jUwVCdIjOaINt.png) Depending on what you plug in. It might show up automatically (if it’s a newer VINT component) or you have to manually choose to listen to one the ports. ![E31148C6-E756-45CE-9A11-74D41FE6B873|600x227, 50%](upload://9PZ5LQgXXFb2B0LUpazUCMlaYW.png) Assuming we have connected a rotary potentiometer like in the picture we can naviage to it’s Hub Port of 0 and open the Voltage Ratio Input which will give us a value between 0 and 1 depending on the how the knob is rotated. ![569546E5-CA55-4102-822C-F3ED5CCA9383|600x264, 75%](upload://uFi8ObTwbvlpmxnzIo8d2KxTjOv.png) Double clicking this should give you this window: ![33E23FD2-6575-44ED-9640-47586506E528|600x313, 75%](upload://fbbyjYG3CjGMPRRc75tkpNvlKIE.png) Changing the knob should change value of Voltage Ratio to the right. As you can see you here can find information such as Hub Port (and Channel) which you often need to connect to the correct sensor. ## Using it in a OPENRNDR This parts assumes you’ve already set up a OPENRNDR project [described in the guide](https://guide.openrndr.org/setUpYourFirstProgram.html). ### Add phidget library to our project To use Phidgets we need to add and configure the Phidgets JAR to our project. [Download the Phidgets zipped from the bottom of this page](https://phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_Java). Unzip the zip if necessary. Create a folder lib under src in your project and put phidget22.jar there. (Note: if your on mac and get a cannot move error you might need to move the jar to the same disk as your project resides first.) ![0BEE05FC-F5C6-4837-B9D8-91454AD3A24E|600x492, 75%](upload://zxh1Il6mlGLlqXjBNSSbUljJtmZ.png) Now we need to configure gradle to use our phidgets library. Open build.gradle.kts. Scroll down to the plugins section and add `java-library` to the plugins section using backticks like so: ``` plugins { java `java-library` kotlin(\"jvm\") version(\"1.4.32\") id(\"com.github.johnrengelman.shadow\") version (\"6.1.0\") id(\"org.beryx.runtime\") version (\"1.11.4\") } ``` Scroll further down to dependencies and add `*implementation*(files(“$*projectDir*/src/lib/phidget22.jar”))` to it like so: ``` dependencies { /* This is where you add additional (third-party) dependencies */ implementation(files(\"$projectDir/src/lib/phidget22.jar\")) // […] } ``` Now you need to load gradle changes. You might also want to build/run your program once as well (this seems to sometimes fix stuff). ![BFC38D70-98B5-433F-AB5F-43A6EDC70F18|600x271, 75%](upload://fTAaS8z0JTJZ6XtncTzQ9f7PJc7.png) ### Get data from the phidgets Now we can finally start to code! Remove most of TemplateProgram so it just becomes program with a empty extend block in it. Let’s just start with a very simple program where you read the voltageRatio once. ```kotlin import com.phidget22.VoltageRatioInput import org.openrndr.application fun main() = application { configure { width = 768 height = 576 } program { val phidgetInput = VoltageRatioInput() // Configure settings depending on what it connected where phidgetInput.isHubPortDevice = true phidgetInput.hubPort = 0 // Use event listening to get value phidgetInput.addVoltageRatioChangeListener { val value = it.voltageRatio println(value) } phidgetInput.open() extend { } } } ``` Running this should print a value based on what you’re doing with your potentiometer or sensor. Remember to close Phidget Control Panel if you still open before you run it! Please note that we use a callback in an eventlistener to get data. Phidgets also have a property that you can use, but if you get data from it too often (like say in OPENRNDRs render loop inside extend { …}) you’ll get problems. It’s a good habit to always use the events for getting data. If we want to display the value graphically we can set a variable in the event and refer to it in the drawing loop like so: ``` … // Use event listening to get value var value = 0.0 phidgetInput.addVoltageRatioChangeListener { value = it.voltageRatio } … extend { val x = value * width drawer.circle(x, 20.0, 5.0) } ``` Now the circle will follow the value of your sensor. We can clean up the code using Kotlin’s built in `with` scoping function and avoid the need to store the object: ``` var value = 0.0 with (VoltageRatioInput()) { // Configure settings depending on what it connected where isHubPortDevice = true hubPort = 0 // Use event to get value addVoltageRatioChangeListener { value = it.voltageRatio } open() } ``` You might notice that the circle doesn’t follow your value smoothly. This is because the dataInterval is set to it’s default of 250ms. To fix this we can set the dataInterval to a lower value, but to do this we must do this inside the onAttach event since phidgets doesn’t allow you to do that if you set it before it’s connected. ``` addAttachListener { dataInterval = 25 } ``` It’s good practice to close your connection when you’re done. Tho if you forget in OPENRNDR it’s probably no big deal as Phidgets automatically close when the program stops, but it’s a good thing to be concious of, espescially if you connect and disconnect from them in the same program. Additionally, on other platforms it’s important to close even if your program stops. We use OPENRNDR ended event to do this: ``` ended.listen { close() } ``` Putting it all toghether again we have this: ```kotlin import com.phidget22.VoltageRatioInput import org.openrndr.application fun main() = application { configure { width = 768 height = 576 } program { var value = 0.0 with (VoltageRatioInput()) { // Configure settings depending on what it connected where isHubPortDevice = true hubPort = 0 // Configuration required to set after attach addAttachListener { dataInterval = 25 } // Use event to get value addVoltageRatioChangeListener { value = it.voltageRatio } open() ended.listen { close() } } extend { val x = value * width drawer.circle(x, 20.0, 5.0) } } } ``` If you have different analog sensors, trying connecting them instead of the one you have connected here. The following examples will just be code with some commentary if needed. ### Digital Input (for example, push button) ```kotlin import com.phidget22.DigitalInput import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa fun main() = application { configure { width = 768 height = 576 } program { var state = false with (DigitalInput()) { hubPort = 0 addStateChangeListener { state = it.state println(\"DigitalInput state changed to ${it.state}\") } open() ended.listen { close() } } extend { if (state) { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.GREEN) } else { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.RED) } } } } ``` ### Draw with joystick Here’s an example where I combine the two (using the Thumbstick Phidget). ``` import com.phidget22.DigitalInput import com.phidget22.VoltageRatioInput import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.draw.isolatedWithTarget import org.openrndr.draw.renderTarget import org.openrndr.launch const val MOVEMENT_MULTIPLIER = 15.0 fun main() = application { configure { width = 768 height = 576 } program { // Use this to draw on val rtCanvas = renderTarget(width, height) { colorBuffer() } drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rtCanvas) { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) } var y = drawer.bounds.center.y with (VoltageRatioInput()) { hubPort = 0 channel = 0 addAttachListener { dataInterval = 25 } addVoltageRatioChangeListener { y += -it.voltageRatio * MOVEMENT_MULTIPLIER } open() ended.listen { close() } } var x = drawer.bounds.center.x with (VoltageRatioInput()) { hubPort = 0 channel = 1 addVoltageRatioChangeListener { x += it.voltageRatio * MOVEMENT_MULTIPLIER } open() ended.listen { close() } } with (DigitalInput()) { hubPort = 0 addStateChangeListener { // Launch a coroutine in the program context // to get back to OpenRNDR drawing thread // since phidget event handlers are run in // a different thread/context launch { drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rtCanvas) { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) } } } open() ended.listen { close() } } extend { drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rtCanvas) { drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE drawer.circle(x, y, 10.0) } drawer.image(rtCanvas.colorBuffer(0)) } } } ``` One thing of notere here is that when I clear the rtCanvas I have to do that within a launch { } block to get back to the main thread, this will fail otherwise. (It’s great that it’s so easy to get back to the drawing thread so easily by just using OPENRNDR’s implementation of launch.) ### DigitalOutput This can be used to control a light or a relay or something. ``` import com.phidget22.DigitalOutput import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa fun main() = application { configure { width = 768 height = 576 } program { // Storing the value and using apply now since // we want to interact with the object later // in order to control the output val digitalOutput = DigitalOutput().apply { channel = 0 open() ended.listen { close() } } var outputActive = false mouse.buttonUp.listen { // Flip the state digitalOutput.state = !digitalOutput.state // Reflect changes in local variable outputActive = digitalOutput.state } extend { if (outputActive) { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.WHITE) } else { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) } } } } ``` ## ++ I\\'ve found Phidgets very useful throughout the years and I\\'m looking forward to test them more with OPENRNDR. Hopefully this might be useful for someone else as well! Some gotchas to be aware of - Sometimes you need to set isHubPortDevice to true, other times not. I\\'m not sure when so I\\'d recommending trying out both if you have trouble connecting. - Several of the methods like open() and others can throw exceptions. In the context of OPENRNDR I\\'ve totally ignored this as OPENRNDR\\'s default behaviour of exiting on exceptions and printing the exception with stack trace is very useful, but depending on what you\\'re doing you might want to catch them. This will not necessarily be the case when using Kotlin in another context. - Setting the dataInterval superlow to something like 1 or 2 usually doesn\\'t work out that well.', ['\\nplugins {\\n

Both the `Screenshots` and `ScreenRecorder` extensions are used extensively. Code has the tendency to break over time (unless you are _very_ careful, but that's maybe not in everybody's time budget), so it is great to have at least some visual documentation of that code around. I often share videos and screenshots with coworkers and clients to communicate ideas. A lot of the work that is made while sketching things does not make the cut. It is great to have screenshots and videos around for later, it has helped me a lot to be able to quickly respond to pitches. Also my playground projects are placed in git repositories.

Why is OPENRNDR crashing with `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` ? -> This is a driver issue of your GPU/CPU misinterpreting memory allocation. In my case, the Windows Update only updated the latest drivers for my BIOS version (MSI B550 from 2019). I went to the MSI site where I downloaded the latest B550 BIOS and flashed it. Afterward a restart, I got a popup for new AMD drivers and was able to update it. 2. Why is OPENRNDR using the wrong GPU ? -> If you have multiple GPUs you can either select it in the Nvidia Control Panel, AMD Radeon Settings (or whatever Intel is using for their Arc series graphics cards) or potentially the Windows \"Graphics Settings\". I had the trickier setup with an Nvidia *and* an AMD on the same computer, so neither vendor menu saw the other\\'s GPU. I always started with the drastically less performant one: `OpenGL renderer: AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics` I took the command that starts the application (the first line in the terminal when running in IntelliJ) which tells you which executable is used: ... In the Windows Graphics Settings, I added it to my preference list and selected the GPU manually. ![graphics_settings|646x500](upload://Am3i1fIwI6eBcXJQCQWWyY8LKeH.png) Thanks to @Abe for the support <3 I also liked the hint with trying out the [Demo suite for LWJGL 3](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-demos).

Having watched interviews from the team, it was nice to hear others sharing a desire to code in powerful IDEs like IntelliJ.

Typically they’re laid out in software like SuperCollider, Max/MSP, Tom Demeyers Image/ine and Gem software for live-el video. An important aim is to get rid of as much as possible of hard/software dependencies, esp. proprietary stuff.

In the audio world, Pure-data vanilla, together with Miller Puckette and others 'pdrp-project: [pdrp project](http://msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/pdrp-07/doc/index.htm) addresses these issues explicitly, and already gets a long way towards minimizing such problems. Some aims: minimizing difficult-to-maintain deps. (maintainance-stop of 3rd-pary libs, core developers changing job...), setting up a comprehensive test-suite to check new builds, and others.

Apparently it's been +3 years since I started experimenting with OPENRNDR and I never took the time to present myself here in the forum! I think I like more helping others than talking about me :slight_smile: But lets do it! My name is [aBe](https://hamoid.com), I started creative coding as a kid by jumping into random memory addresses on a Vic-20 computer. Most of the time this froze the computer, but sometimes it produced crazy random graphics :slight_smile: Another technique I discovered by accident was to plug, unplug or half plug a game cartridge on the computer while it was on. Don't do this! :-) But it also produced interesting visual glitches. In 2011 somehow it became my focus when I started recording Processing video tutorials at https://funprogramming.org Since then I've created many art projects with Processing, p5.js, openFrameworks and OPENRNDR. I am part of [Creative Code Berlin](https://creativecode.berlin/), a community of people mixing art, technology and creativity. We've had hundreds of meetups and presentations and I maintain an [archive here](https://creativecodeberlin.github.io/Stammtisch/). I started using Kotlin out of curiosity, wondering if its syntax would take me to new places in my generative creations. And I can say it did. I find its syntax super enjoyable and easy to read. I can express a lot with few lines of code, and easily transform programs to make them do something new without much effort. In the last 3 years I've written many experiments using OPENRNDR, contributed to the framework itself, created *A life cycle*, an artwork currently exhibited in Berlin and a live version which I recently performed in Linz with [Floating Spectrum](http://floatingspectrum.bandcamp.com/). https://vimeo.com/845233469 One can visit [Khroma (Berlin)](https://khroma.berlin/) before October 2023 to see it :-) To end this post I'm going to copy @Neurotypique and share some of my goals: - Continue creating artworks for my pen-plotter. - Evolve my sound-reactive live visuals which I perform using various MIDI controllers. - Create new organic, slowly evolving generative artworks. - Improve the framework and its guide so more people can join and enjoy it. - Help others if they get stuck. - Promote OPENRNDR and continue sharing [videos](https://tubedu.org/c/in_conversations_collections/videos).

Maintain your local openrndr-template the same way I mentioned above, but have [snapshot set to true](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template/blob/4631eced386756f9413e2b312cc566485a2afccc/settings.gradle.kts#L4-L6). What that does is to skip the released packages available in [maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openrndr) and use packages built locally. 2. Clone [openrndr](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr) and [orx](https://github.com/openrndr/orx) once into your computer so you can build them locally. 3. When you want to update them: pull changes for both. 4. To build them run `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -P\"release.version=0.5.1-SNAPSHOT\"` first for openrndr, then for orx. It can take a minute or two the first time. If you make changes to the code building for a second time takes a few seconds. Was your question about the first or the second case?', [])",

          "(\"Just want to write down what my recent tinkering with Gradle and Github Actions has amounted to, as I think some of it may be really useful to others. ## Mesa / SWR I have made a custom built of Mesa with Intel's SWR rasterizer. [SWR](https://www.openswr.org/) is a software implementation of OpenGL, it currently supports most if not all of OpenGL 3.3 core features. On Github Actions you use this library in combination with `xvfb-run` to run OpenGL programs in a virtual graphical environment. This work I compiled into a reusable action that is available on the Github Marketplace for everyone to use. The action is called [`openrndr/setup-gl`](https://github.com/openrndr/setup-gl) To be clear, this allows one to run OPENRNDR applications (but also other OpenGL progams) inside a Github Action. ## ORX demos Some time ago I added a `demo` sourceset to ORX, that allows developers to supply demos of their extras. Demos are not packaged into the release artifacts, and `demo` sourcesets have their own set of dependencies which makes it possible to add dependencies for demo purposes only. The demos can be executed directly from the source tree, in IntelliJ this works like executing any OPENRNDR program. Now that the `demo` source sets work, and there is a collection of demos, I figured it would be nice to write a Gradle task that discovers all demos and runs them to collect screenshots. I also wrote some tooling to append links to the demos and screenshots to the corresponding `README.md` files. The original idea was to store the generated media in the git repo along with the sources. However, this would bloat the repository over them, especially if at some point videos are added to the generated media. Instead we store the generated media in an orphan `media` branch on the the ORX repository. ## Conclusion Combined with the work that enables OpenGL on Github Actions it is now possible to generate up-to-date screenshots and updated `README.md` documentation on commit. It is fully automated! ORX documentation is now both much richer and easier to author. This work opens up ways to improve the process for the OPENRNDR guide [Example `README.md` with screenshots](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-jvm/orx-gui) #### Encore I replaced the Bintray task in the ORX gradle build with a simple `zip` on `/.m2/repository/org/openrndr/extra/:version/*` and `curl` bash script. Uploading a single zip to Bintray improves things in two ways: 1) it is faster (total time spent on the publication went down from 20 minutes to 7 minutes). 2) it is atomic, which solves a problem where we ended up with incomplete but public artifacts on Bintray.\", [])",

Welcome to the forum :slight_smile: I'm copying here from Slack the solution you came up with: ![image|690x420](upload://uhnxGpRLWakr8jynE1zfyvaDc1v.jpeg) In words: specifying the PATH environment variables manually in the IDE so ffmpeg is found. Your question motivated me to finally send this [PR](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/pull/365) to make OPENRNDR use the ffmpeg binary provided by one of its dependencies. That would have been great because then people wouldn't need to install ffmpeg themselves, but Edwin noticed that the videos produced that way looked worse, because libx264 was not part of that ffmpeg build. But the story doesn't end there :) Looking at the [build scripts](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/blob/master/ffmpeg/cppbuild.sh) Edwin also noticed a line of code there, which led him to find out that by [changing the ffmpeg dependencies to the GPL version](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/commit/8c5442dff5fdf5e27d0d103d5ede83db681b8762) libx264 would be provided :) So it looks like the framework will soon figure out automatically the binary to use.\", [])",

          "('The following tip can be interesting **if you have many runnable programs in the same project** and want to apply extensions or behaviors to all of them. I have over a hundred OPENRNDR programs in the same clone of `openrndr-template`. Most had repeated code to - take **Screenshots** by pressing the space key. - **quit by pressing ESC** (something I inherited from Processing). - be able to **record video** when something visually interesting happens, but not always, otherwise I\\'ll fill my disk with video files. The following trick shows how to move these behaviors to a common file, so all programs have them. It involves adding a class to your `openrndr-template` which extends `ApplicationPreload`. For example, create the following file ``` openrndr-template/src/main/kotlin/org/openrndr/Preload.kt ``` with this content: ``` package org.openrndr import org.openrndr.extensions.Screenshots import org.openrndr.ffmpeg.ScreenRecorder class Preload : ApplicationPreload() { // change default window size // override fun onConfiguration(configuration: Configuration) { // configuration.width = 1200 // configuration.height = 600 // } override fun onProgramSetup(program: Program) { // 1. Add video recording val screenRecorder = ScreenRecorder().apply { outputToVideo = false } program.extend(screenRecorder) // 2. Add screenshots (space key by default) program.extend(Screenshots()) program.keyboard.keyDown.listen { when { // 3. Quit with ESC key it.key == KEY_ESCAPE -> program.application.exit() // Use a key to toggle video output it.name == \"v\" -> { screenRecorder.outputToVideo = !screenRecorder.outputToVideo println(\"ScreenRecorder: ${if (screenRecorder.outputToVideo) \"ON\" else \"OFF\"}\") } } } } } ``` After adding that file I [searched and deleted](https://github.com/hamoid/openrndr-template/commit/e978ed56cf92269b51f8f579acfb8561cb0fd216) any uses of the Screenshots, ScreenRecorder and the ESC key quitting in my programs. To make it work we [added](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/commit/75fb2ddea728ea8e760d3cf130b34d5ce6c71f2a) the `outputToVideo` property the `ScreenRecorder` class so **it is now possible to turn video recording on and off during program execution**. In the class above it is set to false by default, so no video is produced until you press the `v` key. Also notice how pressing it toggles the state, allowing you to export multiple takes to the same video file.

          "(\"Hi! :slight_smile: Since today there is a [next-version branch](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template/tree/next-version) in the openrndr-template repo. Why? As OPENRNDR and the ORX extensions are developed, sometimes an alpha version is released. You may want to use the latest version because it fixed some bug or because some new feature you can't wait to try. There are two ways to tray the most recent versions. One is to to clone the openrndr and orx repos and build them yourself. But if you are less adventurous, you can use an alpha release instead. The `next-version` branch of the `openrndr-template` will accumulate the alpha releases until the next proper release happens. A safer way to live a bit more on the edge :-) At the time of writing, the `next-version` branch adds [7 new orx extensions](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template/compare/master...next-version) and uses the 0.4.3-alpha9 versions of openrndr and orx. Changelogs: [openrndr](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/compare/c063b39e09b992e977d5f3a9578b1fa865327925...0ee5625dfa21fbe015d8f2bfc958dfd337908b64) and [orx](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/compare/e4d983c683ee9c91506236f62433523ce4214a29...e5e82425f28b41c910248ca40fca021077377ae9). ## How to use `next-version` ### Clone & play ```text git clone https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template.git cd openrndr-template/ git checkout next-version ``` Then have fun with the new features and orx'es :-) ### Alternative: manually apply its changes to your own template If you don't want to clone the template again, you can manually apply [these changes](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template/compare/master...next-version) to your existing one. ## orx-marching-squares Here an image created with one of the new orx extensions to add some color to this post: ![](upload://o0rkbQtzRuOnAC5UU3gDcg9umRs.png)\", ['text\\ngit clone https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template.git\\ncd openrndr-template/\\ngit checkout next-version\\n'])",

This is useful in cases in which you want to make changes to OPENRND and ORX and be able to see their effect in your work immediately. Here immediately means without having to go through the process of running `gradle publishToMavenLocal -Prelease.version=0.4.0-SNAPSHOT`. Composite projects are also convenient when you work with the debugger and want to set breakpoints inside OPENRNDR or ORX. # Step 1: clone repositories ```!sh mkdir composite cd composite git clone https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr git clone https://github.com/openrndr/orx git clone https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template ``` Note here that I make folder called `composite` here, this will function as the top-level project in IntelliJ IDEA. You can pick whatever name you like for it. # Step 2: start IntelliJ IDEA From terminal (but possible in other ways too), start IntelliJ. IntelliJ will treat our `compsite` folder as a project. You probably need to install IntelliJ command-line tools for this work. ``` idea ``` # Step 3: Import gradle projects For each of the modules `openrndr` , `openrndr-template` , and `orx` locate the build.gradle or build.gradle.kts files and use \"Import Gradle Project\" on them. ![Screenshot from 2020-04-09 10-55-13|641x500, 100%](upload://6jhVyaEkzxTT3zIQA0XOAmkzC0A.png) # Step 4: Configure composite builds * Open the Gradle view on the right. * Right click on `openrndr-template` and open \"Composite Build Configuration\".

In build.gradle.kts we have to change the line `runtimeOnly(openrndr(\"gl3\"))` to `implementation(openrndr(\"gl3\"))` otherwise the GL3 back-end cannot be resolved (for reasons unclear to me) # Step 6: Fix run configuration When IntelliJ launches programs it will set the CWD to composite, so you will have to change the working directory to `composite/openrndr-template` ![Screenshot from 2020-04-09 11-05-25|690x413, 100%](upload://jqlsM4cr74uFbo4jlGgwu2JJqj2.png) That\\'s it.

Regarding the creative code \"approach and mindset\" that is something that I suppose is best built over time like with any other art/craft form. There are some starting points if you want to start fiddling around (popular one is the [Computational Manual](https://dpmanual.bitbucket.io/) which also features a few examples using OPENRNDR), but I personally think it is more fun to find your own distinct way by setting up small intentional goals, to avoid falling into the stereotypical. Regarding the ML implementations with OR, there is definitely a RunwayML implementation but I found that to be quite slow and cumbersome. The cutting-edge is now in [ORML](https://orml.openrndr.org/) which has great tools to start experimenting easily.

          "('For debugging it may be useful to see all the OPENGL commands being sent to the GPU, the textures, mesh data, shaders, etc. [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) makes that possible. This is how I got it running in Ubuntu: 1. Download RenderDoc. In my case I downloaded the source and compiled it to have the latest version. This installed the file `/usr/lib/librenderdoc.so`. In ArchLinux I would use the system package instead of compiling. 2. In Idea, go to `Run > Edit Configurations...` and under `Environment Variables` enter `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/librenderdoc.so` (or whatever is the path to the library in your case). (thanks @edwin) ![editconf|690x34](upload://vpM6C6OYG0gTUbfg0kIqpubVLWY.png) 3. Launch the RenderDoc program (in my case called `qrenderdoc`) 4. Start your OPENRNDR program. There should be a new text overlay on the top part of the window. ![inactive|690x70](upload://skDhKHusIxHx1JZXaKtiuwJkNis.png) Initially it says `Inactive Window`, then it changes to this: ![active|690x53](upload://tGfbu97KwSW6xzye3ScH0WsnL7y.png) 5.

One of the main reasons given is that they are reliable in ways Arduino and Raspberry Pis just aren't. Personally I dislike to solder and fiddle with the hands-on stuff of electronics. Before I used Phidgets I used Seeeduino Grove System (which is kinda like SparkFun qwiic) for Arduino where you can just snap components to it very easily. However, I had to fiddle with getting information from the Arduino to the computer. Writing an Arduino program til send the data along or use Firmata. Personally I find Phidgets just much easier to work with and prototype with (_espescially_ in Kotlin), tho I've done most work with it in JavaScript. I like that it's comes with proper API and documentation and feels much less like a hack.

          "(\"I recently did a 30 minute session for Github Satellite on live coding in OPENRNDR. If you haven't seen it, you can see a recording of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdgnRct0_nw&feature=youtu.be&t=12428). In the week running up to this session I decided to try out some new ideas for `orx-olive`. It all started with an idea on our Slack's #development channel: what if live coding versions of OPENRNDR programs were very similar (if not the same) to normal OPENRNDR programs. For those unaware of what the process of live coding in OPENRNDR looks like, you create a small host application and use `extend(Olive())`. After starting that application you will find a `.kts` file next to the application. While the application runs it will watch for changes to the Kotlin script file and attempts to reload a _program function_ from the script. This old mode works but it is a bit unwieldy, as there is no good way to transform an existing OPENRNDR program into a Kotlin script based program, and vise versa. My idea to improve this situation was to introduce `oliveProgram {}` . This construction replaces `program` , installs `orx-olive` and serves as an anchor to indicate code that should be reloaded. ```kotlin fun main() = application { oliveProgram { // -- reloadable code goes here } } ``` Because Kotlin (`.kt`) and Kotlin script (`.kts`) are largely written in the same language we can watch the `.kt` file for changes, extract the code that is inside the `oliveProgram` block and generate Kotlin script source for it. To make things work we also need to copy the import list to the script. The generated script is then handed to the mechanism that loads and applies the program function. That leaves us with one unsolved problem: extracting code from Kotlin sources. In prior projects we wrote tools based on [kastree](https://github.com/cretz/kastree), but that library is no longer maintained. An alternate library is [kotlinx/ast](https://github.com/kotlinx/ast), but I had a hard time building it and figuring out what it does. So I turned to the `kotlin-spec` repo that holds [Antlr grammar files](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec/blob/master/grammar/src/main/antlr/). Using the Antlr grammar it is a simple process of generating parsers and a parse tree visitor for the Kotlin language. So that's it! If you feel like trying out the new live coding interface you can now use it from the [OPENRNDR template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template).\", ['kotlin\\nfun main() = application {\\n    oliveProgram {\\n        // -- reloadable code goes here\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",

I've also studied cinema and currently graphic design, and I'm now considering transitioning my career path or at least finding a hybrid between my technical background and creative interests. I'm particularly interested in exploring technologies like OPENRNDR, Processing, and TouchDesigner, but I'm unsure how to proceed in terms of finding work and establishing myself in these fields without relying solely on full-time job relationships, which is more common in other areas of software development. I would love to hear from those who have successfully made similar transitions or have experience working in creative industries. How did you get started? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them? Do you have any recommendations or insights for someone looking to explore these technologies and fields as a freelancer or independent creative? Please feel free to share your own path, previous experiences, recommendations, and any resources or tips you think would be valuable to someone in my position. Looking forward to the discussion!

          "(\"Hi, It's not directly related to OPENRNDR, but thanks to this project I've learned enough WebGL to be able to start building OPENRNDR web target, hopefully, if I will have enough time for that. https://xemantic.github.io/shader-web-background/ This project is doing exactly what the name suggests - allows to use shaders on the web. It doesn't sound much different than shadertoy and glslCanvas. However when I had been evaluating each of the libraries abstracting WebGL, I was also finding limitations making them unsuitable for my vision. And my vision is to treat the web browser as a tool of my expression, in a declarative way, and forget about technicalities. There are solutions for building responsive websites. I wanted something similar for shaders, where they can become part of web development workflow also suitable for Progressive Web Applications: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application So now I can start rendering shaders immediately before any other web resources are loaded, while reacting to mobile device orientation sensors, and presenting already GPU accelerated CSS animatons on another layer, while benefiting from high quality SVG and font rendering of engines like WebKit. And all of this while being compatible with most of the browsers and hardware. It was much more work than I expected, but it will be also a base for many of my future projects, especially in the times when I cannot make physical installations on top of OPENRNDR, because there is no audience allowed to experience them. Maybe it will be also useful for you as an additional channel for sharing your work. And I am getting more and more serious about OPENRNDR web target, with kotlin JS + WebGL.\", [])",

The following program will throw an exception whenever the slider is touched. ```kotlin fun main() = application { program { val cm = controlManager { layout { slider { events.valueChanged.listen { require(false) { \"Pretty clear exception messages\" } } } } } extend(cm) } } ``` Prior to version 0.3.40, whever we would touch the slider we would see a very lengthy wall of text (which turns out to be a dump of the stack trace), that would require a lot of work to decode. First of all the order of the dump is in a way that the root cause is found near the top of the dump, which means we would have to scroll through several pages of text just to find the root cause. So we reversed the order. We also added coloring to the dump and attempt to highlight the parts of the call stack that are in user code. User code nearest to the root cause now has an extra clear highlight. The stack trace shows Kotlin classes and functions as JVM classes, those names look like `Program01Kt$main$1$1cm$1$2` and are not easily understandable to the untrained user. The stack trace printer in version 0.3.40 attempts to decode the JVM class names to present an easier to read dump.

It's not in a hidden internal IDE database, which would be harder to sync. - Seeing it at the top of your file invites you to write a description for your program, which can help you understand it later. - You can rename the Kotlin files outside of the IDE and the thumbnail stays in sync, because the metadata wouldn't change. **meh** - A plugin that edits your code might be considered heresy by some :slight_smile: - It could potentially mess up your code if I did it wrong. Maybe where to store the metadata could be user selectable? If I receive feedback and make it user friendlier (an about screen? an integrated user manual? More configurable?) I could release it in the market to make it easier to install. ### Coming features - I'm adding a feature to update the readme.md of the currently open project to show the thumbnails with links to each programs. Something like what you can see in [this repo](https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming).

When I started experimenting with OPENRNDR I remember thinking that I should repeat this process every time: clone the template, wait for indexing, etc. Not ideal if you want to create lots of experiments. BUT It's not necessary! :) ## You can stick to one template! Instead of editing `src/main/kotlin/TemplateProgram.kt` directly, every time I want a new program I right click on that file to copy & paste (= duplicate) giving it a new name. If a program grows to be 2 or 3 files I create a package for it and move those files into that package. That way I can iterate fast and jump between experiments within one IDE project. ![2020-04-11-100001_339x944_scrot|179x500](upload://c0JmkFt7aW7g82aqPX3EbxHKNTW.png) Maybe a bit messy but hey, it's my playground :) One drawback may be that all files need to be in a compilable state. That means that you can't leave a file mid sentence and continue with another file. That mid sentence needs to be commented out. In some cases I comment out the whole file if it's not the right time to work on it. What are your approaches and tricks to experimenting and iterating? ps. One nice feature of the `Screenshot()` extension is that it saves the image with the name of the file that produced it. Same when exporting video files. That means that even if I only have one screenshots folder, the files are automatically named after the kotlin program that produced it.

I suppose maybe they could fit into ORX or something? > I need to experiment with those too. They can be fun to work with. I have to say that in general Kotlin is the most fun programming language I've ever touched, and it's a good fit for OPENRNDR since that adds to the fun, which I think is very important for creative coding as it's a hobby for many of us. > Latest additions to the Kotlin-based shading language are related to compute shaders. Unfortunately not yet for Mac. I hope those cross-platform (Vulkan) approaches make it possible at some point. My impression is that Vulkan is so difficult that very few outside extremely hard core game developers actually like working with it directly. For example: openFrameworks haven't adopted it either. If we are to move to a new API my guess is that [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) is a better option. It should be noted that [native (i.e. non-web) implementations of WebGPU exist](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native), including a [JVM-wrapper](https://github.com/kgpu/kgpu/tree/master/wgpuj). This means that you have the same GPU API across several native platforms and the web. None of this is very mature though, so unsure if it's ready for prime time. I think something like [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) could be more interesting in short term. It re-implements OpenGL ES using Vulkan, Metal and DirectX backends. This means that we could just carry on as we already do yet retain support. I think maybe it could mean getting compute support for macOS too? I also think OpenGL ES is similar enough to WebGL that it's a reasonable strategy for support web too (I suppose this is what OPENRNDR already does?).

I find that a very interesting question :) I guess it is different for each person. For me it involves play, exploration, following ideas, patterns, behaviors or shapes that I find interesting. Things that come to mind (that can be followed or ignored): - decide to create something daily for a certain amount of days (like 20 or 30 days in a row). - join a local creative coding meetup if there is one - take the journey with a friend or with someone online. It can be more fun to have someone to talk to than doing everything on your own. - sharing your process online. It can help others or start conversations. - don\\'t be concerned about not being good enough.

Close up, far away, zooming, panning, rotating. I use midi controls for Z velocity, panning, rotating, choose a previous camera, create a new camera, Z jump and others. I use physics for camera movements instead of linear interpolation to get a more organic feel. I recently added this to `orx-delegate-magic`.

          "('Hi @LH99 , thank you! I can write a few words, but somehow the thought process is almost under the sun here :slight_smile: I was basically interested in creating the illusion of real-time dynamics but with the dynamics itself already pre-calculated, so that no computation is needed while drawing the frames. I knew that shaderStyle has a uniform that it is basically a coordinate on the contour, so I thought of using it to display just a little bit of the curve via the fragment shader. I then found a solution, posted it here, then @abe showed a much more elegant approach which I started playing with. Since the <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics)\">flow</a> of a dynamical system gives rise to contours, it was immediate to apply this to the flow curves of a dynamical system admitting a stable orbit (well, I\\'m a mathematician, these are the things that are immediate to me :slight_smile: ). Then I take an idea an reiterate in multiple forms. For instance, the sketch above gives directly rise to this ![gif1|500x500](upload://r48ueZQCqK3XnAMMU6s3waHh1Zt.gif) If you look at the code you might think it is something completely different, and to a certain extent it is since it is completely shader based. The foundational ideas that I wanted to explore, though, are the same, and to me that\\'s what matters the most: I rarely know what I will make, most of the time things and paths emerge and I try to follow them. As for writing shaders \"efficiently, without syntax errors\", I can reassure you that I go through many, many errors while coding!

It compares side by side two different noise functions. https://discourse.processing.org/t/perlin-vs-simplex-noise-performance/4189/2 *If you want to compare it to the version below you can open it in another window.* The algorithm is very simple: 1. Current point = random point on the screen. 2. Use the coordinates of that point scaled down to look at a Perlin / Value / Simplex noise function. 3. Map the obtained value to an angle. 4. Use the angle to alter current point moving in polar coordinates. 5. Draw a point at current point with low opacity. 6. Go to 2. This is the OPENRNDR version I came up with: [details=\"imports\"] ```kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.color.rgba import org.openrndr.extra.noclear.NoClear import org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random import org.openrndr.math.Polar ``` [/details] ```kotlin fun main() = application { configure { width = 800; height = 800 } program { val zoom = 0.03 backgroundColor = ColorRGBa.WHITE extend(NoClear()) extend { drawer.fill = rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01) drawer.points(generateSequence(Random.point(drawer.bounds)) { it + Polar( 180 * if (it.x < width / 2) Random.value(it * zoom) else Random.simplex(it * zoom) ).cartesian }.take(500).toList()) } } } ``` **NoClear** By default most graphics frameworks do clear the screen on every animation frame. Processing is unique in not doing that, so it acts more like a canvas: one can keep painting things on that canvas and unless `background()` is called, it stays there. There is a simple extension to achieve that behavior in OPENRNDR, called [`orx-no-clear`](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-no-clear). By using it we can keep painting over what is already in the canvas with very low opacity to achieve a slowly evolving design. The guide explains [how to enable extensions](https://guide.openrndr.org/OPENRNDRExtras/#using-openrndr-extras). **generateSequence** Instead of calling `drawer.point()` multiple times, I decided to call `drawer.points()` once to make it more efficient by using batching. This reduces the number of calls to the GPU from hundreds to just a few. Probably not necessary in this case, but a good exercise :-) For the sake of experimenting, I decided to use `generateSequence` which I never used before. The first argument is the initial value of the sequence, in this case a random point on the screen. The second argument is a function that returns a new point based on `it`, the previous point. [Sequences](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/sequences.html#from-an-iterable) are potentially endless, therefore I `.take(500)` items from that sequence and convert it to a list which makes `drawer.points()` happy. A more straightforward version without batching nor sequences might look like this: ```kotlin // unchanged part ommitted extend { drawer.fill = rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01) var pos = Random.point(drawer.bounds) repeat(500) { drawer.point(pos) pos += Polar( 180 * if (pos.x < width / 2) Random.value(pos * zoom) else Random.simplex(pos * zoom) ).cartesian } } ``` **Other noise functions** `Random` provides several functions you can play with: `Random.value()`, `Random.simplex()`, `Random.cubic()`, `Random.perlin()` and [more](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-noise). **Moving through the noise space** We can make a tiny change to the original program above to make the noise field change over time: ```kotlin Random.simplex(pos.vector3(z = seconds) * zoom) ``` What that does is to create a `Vector3` out of `pos` (a `Vector2`) setting the `z` component to the current time. That produces a more blurry image: ![2021-03-11-093250_800x800_scrot|500x500](upload://zBl53m5ghyCFcSVJi4Fx0bMbshu.jpeg) :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=%22Processing%22%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['kotlin\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.color.rgba\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.noclear.NoClear\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Polar\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure { width = 800; height = 800 }\\n    program {\\n        val zoom = 0.03\\n        backgroundColor = ColorRGBa.WHITE\\n        extend(NoClear())\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.fill = rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01)\\n            drawer.points(generateSequence(Random.point(drawer.bounds)) {\\n                it + Polar(\\n                    180 * if (it.x < width / 2)\\n                        Random.value(it * zoom)\\n                    else\\n                        Random.simplex(it * zoom)\\n                ).cartesian\\n            }.take(500).toList())\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', 'kotlin\\n        // unchanged part ommitted\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.fill = rgba(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.01)\\n            var pos = Random.point(drawer.bounds)\\n            repeat(500) {\\n                drawer.point(pos)\\n                pos += Polar(\\n                    180 * if (pos.x < width / 2)\\n                        Random.value(pos * zoom)\\n                    else\\n                        Random.simplex(pos * zoom)\\n                ).cartesian\\n            }\\n        }\\n', 'kotlin\\nRandom.simplex(pos.vector3(z = seconds) * zoom)\\n'])",

This post describes the new functionality and was posted by Edwin [on Slack](https://openrndr.slack.com/archives/CARR3S953/p1627370001118200?thread_ts=1627317411.116300&cid=CARR3S953) in July 2021. ## It starts with functions We know that `simplex3D` is a (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double Here `(Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double` is our commonly used function signature for noise functions that given an `Int` seed and a 3d coordinate returns a scalar noise value. `perlin3D`, `value3D` etc. use that same signature. `orx-noise` already had a `fbm` function that is much like ```kotlin fun fbm(lacunarity:Double, gain:Double, seed:Int, x:Double, y:Double, z:Double, noise: (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double): Double ``` So that too is a scalar noise function, however with a different signature. orx-`noise` also has an `fbmFunc3D` function that instead of returning a scalar returns a function with our noise function signature. ```kotlin inline fun fbmFunc3D( crossinline noise: (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double, octaves: Int = 8, lacunarity: Double = 0.5, gain: Double = 0.5 ): (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double ``` You'd use `fbmFunc3D` to *compose* a new function like this: val fbmSimplex = fbmFunc3D(simplex3D) Which can be used like any other function. val noise = fbmSimplex(432, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0) Since our fbmSimplex has the `(Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double` signature we can apply `fbmFunc3D` on it again if we want to: val fbmFbmSimplex = fbmFunc3D(fbmSimplex, lacunarity = 1.3222) Or alternatively, to demonstrate how quickly this becomes hard to read: val fbmFbmSimplex = fbmFunc3D(fbmFunc3D(simplex3D), lacunarity = 1.3222) To improve readability I introduce the use of [extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html#extension-functions), I assume the reader knows what those are. The `fbm` function is an extension function on functions with the `(Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double)` signature: ```kotlin fun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).fbm : (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double ``` It does the same thing as fbmFunc3D, which is to return a function.So now we can compose our previous noise functions without clutter: ```kotlin val fbmSimplex = simplex3D.fbm() val fbmFbmSimplex = simplex3D.fbm().fbm(lacunarity = 1.3222) ``` Now let's look into some of the additional tooling I made. ## `.crossFade()` `crossFade` is used for seamless noise looping animations and assumes the z axis of 3D noise functions is used for time. (Perhaps it makes sense to have generalized version of this in which the axis/axes can be specified). The `crossFade` function uses the *receiver* noise function (`this`) to calculate a blend. The `start`, `end` and `width` arguments are used to define the loop of the `z` value. ```kotlin fun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).crossFade( start: Double, end: Double, width: Double = 0.5): (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double { return { seed, x, y, z -> val a = z.map(start, end, 0.0, 1.0).mod_(1.0) val f = (a / width).coerceAtMost(1.0) val o = this(seed, x, y, a.map(0.0, 1.0, start, end)) * f val s = this(seed, x, y, (a + 1.0).map(0.0, 1.0, start, end) * (1.0 - f)) o + s } } ``` ## `.withVector2Output()` The `withVector2Output` function changes the function signature to return `Vector2` instead of `Double`. So the noise function outputs 2d noise, classically you'd pass in different seeds and juggle a bit with your input coordinates to get uncorrelated but similarly distributed noise for x and y. `withVector2Output` does that for you by xor-ing the seed and rotating x,y by 90 degrees. Also here we assume the z axis is used for time. ```kotlin fun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).withVector2Output(): (seed: Int, x: Double, y: Double, z: Double) -> Vector2 = { seed, x, y, z -> Vector2(this(seed, x, y, z), this(seed xor 0x7f7f7f7f, y, -x, z)) } ``` ## `.gradient()` And finally, we have gradient function. Which returns a function that approximates the gradient of the receiver function, also known as ([curl noise](https://al-ro.github.io/projects/curl/)): ```kotlin fun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Vector2).gradient(epsilon: Double = 1e-2 / 2.0): (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Vector2 = { seed, x, y, z -> val dfdx = (this(seed, x + epsilon, y, z) - this(seed, x - epsilon, y, z)) / (2 * epsilon) val dfdy = (this(seed, x, y + epsilon, z) - this(seed, x, y - epsilon, z)) / (2 * epsilon) dfdx + dfdy } ``` ## Notes and references * FBM stands for [fractal brownian motion](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/). * [Lacunarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacunarity) * [Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) * [Tutorials about looping noise](https://bleuje.github.io/tutorial3/) by Etienne Jacob *Original text by Edwin, formatted and edited by Abe, reference links by Yann.*\", ['kotlin\\nfun fbm(lacunarity:Double, gain:Double, \\n  seed:Int, x:Double, y:Double, z:Double, \\n  noise: (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double): Double\\n', 'kotlin\\ninline fun fbmFunc3D(\\n    crossinline noise: (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double,\\n    octaves: Int = 8,\\n    lacunarity: Double = 0.5,\\n    gain: Double = 0.5\\n): (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double\\n', 'kotlin\\n    fun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).fbm : \\n         (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double\\n', 'kotlin\\nval fbmSimplex = simplex3D.fbm()\\nval fbmFbmSimplex = simplex3D.fbm().fbm(lacunarity = 1.3222)\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).crossFade(\\n    start: Double, end: Double, width: Double = 0.5): \\n     (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double {\\n    return { seed, x, y, z ->\\n        val a = z.map(start, end, 0.0, 1.0).mod_(1.0)\\n        val f = (a / width).coerceAtMost(1.0)\\n        val o = this(seed, x, y, a.map(0.0, 1.0, start, end)) * f\\n        val s = this(seed, x, y, (a + 1.0).map(0.0, 1.0, start, end) * (1.0 - f))\\n        o + s\\n    }\\n}\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Double).withVector2Output(): \\n    (seed: Int, x: Double, y: Double, z: Double) -> Vector2 =\\n    { seed, x, y, z -> Vector2(this(seed, x, y, z), \\n                               this(seed xor 0x7f7f7f7f, y, -x, z)) }\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun ((Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Vector2).gradient(epsilon: Double = 1e-2 / 2.0): \\n     (Int, Double, Double, Double) -> Vector2 =\\n    { seed, x, y, z ->\\n        val dfdx = (this(seed, x + epsilon, y, z) - this(seed, x - epsilon, y, z)) / (2 * epsilon)\\n        val dfdy = (this(seed, x, y + epsilon, z) - this(seed, x, y - epsilon, z)) / (2 * epsilon)\\n        dfdx + dfdy\\n    }\\n'])",

          "(\"Hi, I rewrote C implementation of FastLiteNoise into GLSL. As far as I am aware it hasn't been done before and I would like to share with you in case someone is curious. I needed mostly 3d variant and it seems to work in real time scenarios with no big hiccups. In fact, is quite fast. I hasn't tested 2d, but it is included and doesn't make any harm to the rest of the code. If someone needs it as it is, just grab it, but if someone fancy to review it and give suggestions, find a bug, even better. I haven't created PR with GLSL code to upstream repo yet but I should do it in forthcoming days.

          "(\"So the way those shaders Iinked above where used was via `Filter`. A list was declared in this file https://github.com/openrndr/orx/blob/579ddf9bb55fe133c600751fc2cd82a8d4e24459/orx-noise/src/main/kotlin/filters/NoiseFilters.kt You can read about filters at https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/filtersAndPostProcessing.html and https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/filtersAndPostProcessing.html See the `Checkers` filter, as I think it's similar in that the noise ones don't use an input, just produce an output. These used to work, but when OPENRNDR was made multiplatform (so you can output Java bytecode to run on desktop, or JavaScript programs to run on the browser) those files fell through the cracks. You can see that the file structure changed from [here](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/579ddf9bb55fe133c600751fc2cd82a8d4e24459/orx-noise/src) to [here](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-noise/src), so to bring the files back is maybe not as simple as undeleting the files and placing them where they used to be. Making it work in the JVM version shouldn't be hard. I don't know though what would be the approach to load shader files in JS. One place to look for that is in the openrndr repo, as the core does use basic shaders somehow in the JavaScript version already. That's what I can say for now :)\", [])",

More specifically, the following lines ``` computeA.buffer(\"particlesColor\", bufferA) //computeB.buffer(\"particlesColor\", bufferA) computeB.buffer(\"particlesBuffer\", bufferB) computeB.buffer(\"particlesVels\", bufferC) ``` will do the following * computeA will set its internal binding counter to 0 and bind bufferA to binding point 0; * computeB will set its internal binding counter to 0 and bind bufferB to binding point 0; * computeB will increase by 1 its internal binding counter and bind bufferB to binding point 1. Most probably the binding happens via writing over , and the counter is not shared amongst the instances of ComputeShader. To support this, try substituting the above lines with the following ``` computeB.buffer(\"particlesColor\", bufferA) computeA.buffer(\"particlesColor\", bufferA) computeB.buffer(\"particlesBuffer\", bufferB) computeB.buffer(\"particlesVels\", bufferC) ``` According to my educated guess above, these line will do the following * computeB will set its internal binding counter to 0 and bind bufferA to binding point 0; * computeA will set its internal binding counter to 0 and bind bufferA to binding point 0; * computeB will increase by 1 its internal binding counter and bind bufferB to binding point 1. * computeB will increase by 1 its internal binding counter and bind bufferB to binding point 2. and indeed, if you run the code you will see that you get the *expected behavior*.

          "(\"@ricardo - sure, though it is not too deep actually: first step was to define a spiral object, given starting point, angle of starting arc, distance to center and 'steepness' of the logarithmic spiral. With that in hand, starting from one spiral I pick some starting point in the outer arm of the spiral as start for the next spiral, space permitting. Iteration then basically randomly (I had tried to be clever in finding space, but in the end random seemed good enough). Depending on how much variation is allowed for size and steepness in the new spirals, very different patterns emerge (these are basically represented in the upper two plots in the previous post). Then I tried to allow also (small) spirals in the inner parts of existing spirals - eg as seen in the last white one (of the previous post). While aiming to that I first forgot to check spacing with the parent spirals - allowing only overlaps between direct parent and child. Actually I think that was a lucky mistake, as I like the generated black version (previous post) very much :slight_smile: There are always so many things to try - eg here still 2 more: first where 'steepness' depends on place to generate a gradient effect, second to create kind of a 'metaspiral' pattern by varying the size of spirals based on another larger spiral pattern. ![SpiralFill5Generator_20200820_183913_gradient_with_b.svg|500x500, 50%](upload://98OLF5GAeE6vNxWUEIMpMrD4iQm.jpeg) ![SpiralFill5Generator_20200818_193242_meta_placedependent.svg|500x500, 50%](upload://5DwGEc3rDNghiU9YjABio0nfvpT.jpeg)\", [])",

The `.trimIndent()` is optional but added automatically by the IDE. It removes indentation white space from strings. The `fragmentTransform` part is what you need to create a typical `shadeStyle`. That parts ends up inside the `main()` function in the GLSL shader. In this case I also want to define my own functions (the one called `shuffle`) therefore I use the `fragmentPreamble` to inject them above the `main()` function. concept | shadertoy | OPENRNDR --- | --- | --- normalized position | `fragCoord/iResolution.xy` | `c_boundsPosition.xy` image uniform | `iChannel_0` .. `3` | we name it. in this case we choose `img` and it becomes uniform `p_img` inside shader code uv vertical flip | not needed | `uv.y = 1.-uv.y` uv scaling | `uv *= 0.5` | I was happy with the scale output variable | `fragColor` | `x_fill`. This is something special in OPENRNDR, because by default it contains the requested fill color. I overwrite it by using `texture()` to sample pixels from the provided image. But instead of overwriting I could do `x_fill.rgb *= 1.2;` to make the requested color brighter for all pixels, `x_fill.rgb *= 0.8;` to make them darker or `x_fill.rgb *= 1.0 + 0.1 * sin(c_boundsPosition.x);` to create a horizontal wavy gradient based on the requested fill color. Don\\'t worry if you don\\'t understand shaders yet, my goal here was only to show similarities and differences between shadertoy code and a similar program written in OPENRNDR.

But after some research, it seem Processing doesn\\'t do as much as I thought it did. The windows are still the same size in Processing and OpenRNDR. I think the \"blurriness\" I notice is due to the antialiasing being different (and I\\'m probably just not used to it yet). It seems both frameworks do a few things in a few different ways, one way not being necessarily better than the other. I wrote the same square packing program in Processing and and OpenRNDR to compare. You probably need to save the screenshots to be able to zoom in without everything being blurry. (here the windows are set to 400x400) I uploaded the files to a Drive since I\\'m not allowed to use more than 1 embedded file in my post : [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_N6y-FdIYgBjJzJbsPBFlcCJkangZIR?usp=sharing) Here is a breakdown of the screenshots : - *\"openrndr vs processing dense.png\"* : OpenRNDR on the left and processing on the right (with `pixelDensity(2)`). - *\"openrndn vs processing normal.png\"* : The same comparison with `pixelDensity(1)` in processing. - *\"openrndr.png\"* : Close-up of Openrndr (some light and asymmetrical antialiasing). - *\"processing dense.png\"* : Close-up of Processing (with `pixelDensity(2)`) (some symmetrical antialiasing). - *\"processing normal.png\"* : Close-up of Processing (with `pixelDensity(1)`) (no antialiasing). Making a `Point()` is also different in each case : - Processing without high density makes a point that is 2 pixels wide. - Processing with high density makes a 1 pixel wide point but adds some antialiasing around it. - OpenRNDR actually makes a 1 pixel wide point without any antialiasing added. [only speculations here] The way the antialiasing is handle probably has something to do with the way each frameworks handles floating point coordinates. I used floating point coordinates in both programs. The fact that the antialiasing from processing is more symmetrical may be due to the framework rounding coordinates before drawing the shapes. --- In the end, both frameworks actually make slightly \"blurry\" squares. I wanted to have perfect squares without any antialiasing - It seems the way to go about this on processing is to use `pixelDensity(1)`. It won\\'t use the full potential of a high density screen but at least it won\\'t add any antialiasing. - I\\'m not sure if there is a way to handle this in OpenRNDR. **Maybe disabling antialiasing and forcing the screen density to 1.0 would be a solution ?**', [])",

Essentially, what I do is to a create a grid buffer to check fixed radius interactions, to avoid looping over all the boids, which is terribly expensive. This is quite the usual story for particle simulation and fluid simulation on GPU, but here\\'s how the approach above diverges: the grid buffer does not contain particle indices, but rather cumulated quantities like position and direction for each grid cell. The reason is that to properly retrieve particle infos from a grid of indices one heavily requires sorting the particle buffer by grid index (check <a href=\" https://lesleylai.info/talks/cuda-boid.pdf>\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2014/presentations/S4117-fast-fixed-radius-nearest-neighbor-gpu.pdf\">here</a> for a nice explanation). I wanted to avoid sorting a buffer on the GPU with a bitonic sorter or something like that, so I came up with this cumulative approach (I have not really seen this approach around, but I am sure someone already implemented it). In particular, I also store the number of boids that are present in a given grid cell, so I can average the positions and directions to implement local averaged alignment and cohesion behaviors. The separation behavior is harder to approximate with this approach, so I went for separation from the \"densest\" cell in the neighborhood. Even with all the approximations, it seems to nicely develop a flocking behavior. Of course any comment/suggestion is welcome! :)', ['kotlin\\n    import org.openrndr.Fullscreen\\n    import org.openrndr.KEY_ENTER\\n    import org.openrndr.application\\n    import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\n    import org.openrndr.draw.*\\n    import org.openrndr.extra.gui.GUI\\n    import org.openrndr.extra.parameters.DoubleParameter\\n    import org.openrndr.math.Polar\\n    import org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\n    import org.openrndr.math.Vector3\\n    import org.openrndr.math.transforms.transform\\n    import kotlin.math.PI\\n    \\n    fun main() = application {\\n        configure {\\n            fullscreen = Fullscreen.CURRENT_DISPLAY_MODE\\n        }\\n        program {\\n            val computeWidth = 50\\n            val computeHeight = 10\\n            val particleCount = computeWidth * computeHeight * 32\\n            val gridSize = 200\\n            var swapIndex = false\\n            var randomize = false\\n            val computeShader = ComputeShader.fromCode(\\n                \"\"\"\\n        #version 430\\n        layout(local_size_x = 32, local_size_y = 1, local_size_z = 1) in;\\n        \\n        uniform int gridSize;\\n        uniform int computeWidth;\\n        uniform float width;\\n        uniform float height;\\n        uniform float cohesion;\\n        uniform float alignment;\\n        uniform float separation;\\n        uniform float target;\\n        \\n        uniform vec2 mousePos;\\n        \\n        struct ParticleTransform {\\n          mat4 transform;\\n        };\\n        \\n        struct ParticleProperties {\\n          vec2 velocity;\\n          vec2 dir;\\n        };\\n        \\n        struct GridProperties {\\n            vec3 pos;\\n            vec2 dir;\\n        };\\n        \\n        layout(binding=0) buffer transformsBuffer {\\n            ParticleTransform transforms[];\\n        };\\n        \\n        layout(binding=1) buffer propertiesBuffer {\\n            ParticleProperties properties[];\\n        };\\n        \\n        layout(binding=2) buffer gridPrev {\\n            GridProperties propsPre[];\\n        };\\n        \\n        layout(binding=3) buffer gridNext {\\n            GridProperties propsNext[];\\n        };\\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        void main() {\\n            // Get particle id from global invocation\\n            const uint id = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x + gl_GlobalInvocationID.y * computeWidth * gl_WorkGroupSize.x;\\n            ParticleTransform pt = transforms[id];\\n            ParticleProperties pp = properties[id];\\n            vec2 position = vec2(pt.transform[3][0], pt.transform[3][1]);\\n            vec2 velocity = vec2(pp.velocity.x, pp.velocity.y);\\n            vec2 dir = vec2(pp.dir.x, pp.dir.y);\\n            \\n            // Get cell id according to position\\n            float stepSize = width/gridSize;\\n            int xGrid = int(position.x/stepSize);\\n            int yGrid = int(position.y/stepSize);\\n            uint idGrid = xGrid + yGrid * gridSize;\\n            \\n            // Initialize accumulators\\n            vec2 totPos = vec2(0.0);\\n            vec2 totDir = vec2(0.0);\\n            float count = 0;\\n            float countMax = -1;\\n            int idDensest = -1;\\n            \\n            // Get positions and densest cell.

Of course, shortly after I posted my question, I solved the problem using javax.imageio.ImageIO for image loading, and java.awt.image.BufferedImage and just do a data comparison. For me, I think this is the best as I believe (but haven't tested yet), that this would also run on a headless system without a GPU. I'm just processing an image that is maybe 30x80 tiles (16px x 16px). and there are maybe 40 different tile types to compare against. I think I can also optimize the 40 source tiles by organizing them so that the byte by byte comparison would eliminate non-matches faster. But that might be over-optimizing too soon. With how fast processors are now, I probably don't need to care at the beginning. Thanks for mentioning the difference between where the work is done; CPU vs GPU. That isn't something I'm used to having to think about. If I have time later, I may try the GPU based solution to see how it might compare.\", [])",

One idea to move it forward could be to use an <a href = \"https://www.karlsims.com/papers/ChoreographedImageFlow.pdf\">image flow</a> approach. The key difference here is that since elements are added, one would probably need to work with layers, warp each one individually by iterating the advection, and then recombine it at the end in the given order.

I would map the resulting image onto a 3D model of the sphere in a 3D software and then onto a physical object using four projectors and projection mapping technique. If this solution is not feasible for me, I will utilize the method from this link. https://youtu.be/SSWudanJc7c', [])",

          "('This is a post inspired by a conversation with @kazik at the latest Creative Coding Jam in Berlin. Here\\'s the context: suppose you have a data structure on the GPU (like a texture, a shader buffer object, etc.) and want to find the minimum, or the maximum, or another \"reduction\" of the values it contains; you also want to avoid passing the data back to CPU, because this would highly affect the real-time performance of your application. You might then think \"I\\'m going to use a compute shader for that!\". You are on the right path, but you soon realize something: [compute shaders](https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Compute-Shaders/Introduction) (and shaders in general) are very good for parallel tasks, i.e. problems which can be solved by repeating the same task in *isolated* threads performing computations *concurrently*. The key words here are **isolated** and **concurrent**: a thread does not know anything about what another thread is computing and doesn\\'t *always* have a way to know when the computation has ended. Indeed, threads in a compute shader can only *sync* among each other if they belong to the same workgroup. \"Can\\'t I fit all my data in a single workgroup, then?\", unfortunately in most cases one can\\'t. Alright, we have no way to sync *all* the threads, so we will have data race conditions when writing and reading data, what to do now? We can use a technique called [parallel reduction](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf): namely, we can perform the reduction in each workgroup, which we can sync, save back the output, and repeat until the whole data structure fits in a single workgroup. The last point is very much related to how much memory your GPU has, since it will affect the workgroup size, and in turn the shared memory size (which is usually quite small). Here\\'s an implementation of parallel reduction used to compute the minimum value in a buffer of floats (think of it as the lowest brightness of an image, if it helps). To check it is working, we can display two circles with gray value obtained on the GPU via parallel reduction, and on the CPU via the inbuilt kotlin\\'s min function ```kotlin import org.intellij.lang.annotations.Language import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.draw.* import org.openrndr.math.Vector2 import kotlin.math.pow fun main() = application { configure { width = 1000 height = 1000 } program { val workersX = 16 val n = workersX.toDouble().pow(4.0).toInt() // buffer size must be a power of workers group size val buffer = shaderStorageBuffer(shaderStorageFormat { member(\"minimum\", BufferMemberType.FLOAT, n) }) //Create the buffer values; val buff = List(n) { Math.random() + 0.45 } //Compute CPU minimum; val minimumValue = buff.min() buffer.put { buff.forEach { write(it.toFloat()) } } @Language(\"GLSL\") val computeCode = \"\"\" #version 430 layout(local_size_x = ${workersX}, local_size_y = 1) in; uniform int computeWidth; uniform int recursionStep; layout (std430, binding = 0) buffer buffValues { float values[]; }; shared float[${workersX}] localBuff; float reduction(float[${workersX}] arr){ // Compute minimum; float m = arr[0]; for (int i=0; i < arr.length(); i++){ if (arr[i] < m){ m = arr[i]; } } return m; } void main(){ const int id = int(gl_LocalInvocationID.x); const int k = int(gl_WorkGroupID.x); int stride = int(pow(${workersX}, recursionStep)); int globalId = (id + k * ${workersX}) * stride; localBuff[id] = values[globalId]; barrier(); // Forces threads in the SAME group to be in sync; float minimum = reduction(localBuff); // Compute minimum (or the reduction implemented); // Writes on the local index thread; if (id == 0){ values[k * ${workersX} * stride] = minimum; } } \"\"\".trimIndent() val computeReduce = ComputeShader.fromCode(computeCode, \"reduction\") computeReduce.buffer(\"buffValues\", buffer) extend { // The copy should happen through a compute shader, // here done on CPU for debugging\\'s sake. buffer.put { buff.forEach { write(it.toFloat()) } } // Compute reduction by val numSteps = n / workersX var dispatchNum = numSteps var s = 0 while(dispatchNum >= 1){ computeReduce.uniform(\"recursionStep\", s) computeReduce.uniform(\"computeWidth\", dispatchNum) computeReduce.execute(dispatchNum, 1) dispatchNum /= workersX s += 1 } drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE drawer.stroke = null drawer.shadeStyle = shadeStyle { fragmentTransform = \"\"\" x_fill.rgb = vec3(b_buff.minimum[0]); \"\"\".trimIndent() buffer(\"buff\", buffer) //That\\'s how you can access a buffer in the graphics pipeline :) } drawer.circle(drawer.bounds.center - Vector2.UNIT_X * 50.0,100.0) drawer.shadeStyle = shadeStyle { fragmentTransform = \"\"\" x_fill.rgb = vec3(p_min); \"\"\".trimIndent() parameter(\"min\", minimumValue) } drawer.circle(drawer.bounds.center + Vector2.UNIT_X * 50.0,100.0) } } } ``` You\\'ll see that the two disks have exactly the same gray value. :) The very same approach can be used for other reductions, like maximum or average, and also for other data structure like textures.

Purpose |Processing |OPENRNDR ---|---|--- initialize variables |`for` loop|replaced by `List(5){...}` set variables to zero and accumulate wave height|3 `for` loops|replaced by one call to `List(numPoints)` and `.sumOf` used to accumulate the wave height at each point render all the circles|`for` loop|replaced by OPENRNDR\\'s `drawer.circles()` method which takes a list of `Circle` instances The original code toggles between sine and cosine, but I found that unnecessary since sine is basically a shifted cosine :slight_smile: Instead, I created a data class called SineWave which has three properties: frequency, shift and amplitude. I included a `value()` method in that class which takes time and horizontal-position-in-the-waveform as arguments and returns the vertical shift. Note the `rnd` **infix function** at the bottom. It allows me to write ``` SineWave(-5 rnd 5, 0 rnd PI * 2, 10 rnd 30) ``` instead of the longer version ``` SineWave( Random.double(-5.0, 5.0), Random.double0(PI * 2), Random.double(10.0, 30.0) ) ``` Finally, see how the original code uses 7 \"global\" variables\", a few of them used to express one idea: a collection of sine waves. Kotlin makes it very easy to create data classes, basically in one line of code, grouping related properties together under one object. I used it to try to make it more obvious that we are working with a `List` of `SineWave`s. # Closing thoughts As it happens most of the time, I find the Kotlin code beautiful and easier to understand. The program is called AdditiveWave and it has one line that reads `sineWaves.sumOf` perfectly matching the program name. The Java code feels lower level and needs comments to clarify intentions. It is possible that the lower level code is better for learning or teaching computation, but at least in my daily work I find Kotlin more understandable and easier to work with. I can express myself with less effort and when I look at my previously written OPENRNDR programs I spend less time trying to understand what they do. ps.

What you see in the video are the trails themselves, or rather a colorized version of it using the particle type information, and there's no parameter modulation. I really like seeing the formation of those wavefronts, and the transport of particles that happens around it. Next step is to modulate the various parameters with noise, I guess. :slight_smile: If there's interest in the code let me know and I'll share it: it's quite basic, but it's maybe a useful starting point for how to (and probably how not to as well!) use compute shaders.\", [])",

To create this image I use two render targets, I clear them black and draw white shapes on each. Then I apply blur, and finally use BoofCV to extract the contour of the blurry shapes. I extract one contour from each render target and draw them with different fill colors. *I created it as part of an exercise in which 3 people drew images with pen and paper, passing the image to the next person who would describe it, then passing the description to the next one who would code it.

          "(\"Hi @kiteborn ! Welcome to the forum :slight_smile: In OPENRNDR by default images are stored in the GPU. You can read about [ColorBuffer in the guide](https://guide.openrndr.org/drawing/colorbuffers.html). A simple approach would be to download the images from the GPU to the CPU as a byteBuffer and then compare the bytes one by one. Another approach which is commonly used to compare images is to subtract them. One can draw one image on top of the other with SUBTRACT mode and if the images are identical one should get only zero RGB values. Does performance matter in your case? Is it a fixed number of images to compare? or an endless stream of them? I think what you have in mind can be done either in the CPU or in the GPU. It's probably easier in the CPU but may be faster on the GPU because it could do many more comparisons in parallel.\", [])",

Another cool thing would also be to introduce some optimization on the GLSL code using syncing and shared variables, but to see a proper added value one really needs to sort the particle buffer.

          "(\"Hi hi! Welcome to the forum :) One reason for slower performance might be that particles are never removed (`.isDead` never called). Another one might be that drawing a circle is slower than a bitmap with a circle, but I haven't verified this. But using `CircleBatchBuilder` should definitely help and it doesn't require almost any changes: **Particles class** ```kotlin // changed the type of `drawer` fun run(drawer: CircleBatchBuilder) { update() display(drawer) } ... // changed the type of `drawer` fun display(drawer: CircleBatchBuilder) { drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE.opacify(lifespan) drawer.fill = ColorRGBa(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1) drawer.circle(position.x, position.y, size) } ``` **Main** ```kotlin ... extend { drawer.circles { // wrap in CircleBatchBuilder ps.forEach { it.targ = mouse.position it.update() it.display(this) //send CircleBatchBuilder } } } ... ``` The difference is this: with the original program it sends data to the GPU each time you draw something, which is very inefficient. With the batch builder, it collects all the data you want to draw and sends it at once to the GPU. Be aware that even if the three lines inside `fun display()` haven't changed, the `drawer` object is not of the same type. It only implements a few methods to control fill, stroke and drawing of circles. You can see that yourself by typing `drawer.` and looking at the code suggestions. It's very nice that both `Drawer` and `CircleBatchBuilder` share a small common API :) ps.

In the first one the text is selectable, in the second one the text has been converted to curves. It would not be hard to create a script to convert all lines from a text file into separate curve-based svg files, which could then be loaded into any tool that can render SVG files, for example OPENRNDR. Or even better, create a class in OPENRNDR which calls inkscape and caches the produced svg file.

TextNode)?.text = text requestRedraw() ``` Unfortunately, you can\\'t `bind` on the spot, since the underlying function needs to access `program` to bind to updates, resulting in a `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`.

Just to make all shapes the same type.

My favorite part here is finding the closest Vector2 to the mouse position which goes from 9 lines of code to just 1. One thing that would make that line more readable though is if `Vector2` implemented a method called `.squaredDistance` so you could write `it.squaredDistance(mouse.position)` I also struggled a bit in figuring out the best way to generate the random points because I couldn't find a simple method to generate random values between (0.0, 0.0) and (width, height). This is another way of doing it val points = List(30) { Vector2.uniform(Vector2.ZERO, drawer.bounds.position(1.0, 1.0)) } which gives you 30 points, each one sampled randomly using a uniform distribution between the point (0.0, 0.0) and the point (640.0, 480.0), which happens to be the default size of the window. `drawer.bounds` is the Rectangle that defines the visible area and `.position(1.0, 1.0)` refers to the bottom right corner of that area. :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=Processing%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)\", ['java\\nArrayList<PVector> points = new ArrayList<PVector>();\\nvoid setup() {\\n  size(640, 480); \\n  for(int i=0; i<30; i++) {\\n    points.add(new PVector(random(width), random(height)));\\n  }\\n}\\nvoid draw() {\\n  background(255);\\n  float mind = Float.MAX_VALUE;\\n  PVector found = null;\\n  for(PVector p : points) {\\n    float d = p.dist(new PVector(mouseX, mouseY));\\n    if(d < mind) {\\n      found = p;\\n      mind = d;\\n    }\\n  }  \\n  for(PVector p : points) {\\n    fill(p == found ? #FF0000 : 255);\\n    ellipse(p.x, p.y, 20, 20);\\n  }\\n}\\n', 'kotlin\\nfun main() = application {\\n    program {\\n        val points = List(30) { drawer.bounds.center + drawer.bounds.center * Random.vector2() }\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.WHITE)\\n            val closest = points.minByOrNull { (mouse.position - it).squaredLength }\\n            points.forEach {\\n                drawer.fill = if (it == closest) ColorRGBa.RED else ColorRGBa.WHITE\\n                drawer.circle(it, 20.0)\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",

Here\\'s what I have learned and some suggestions if you are facing the same issue: * Create variables `w` and `h` containing your desired resolution and use them everywhere you would use `width` and `height`, since these get updated after the screensize crops (print `drawer.width` and `drawer.height` to see that); * Render on a render target with dimensions `w` and `h`; * Draw explicitly to `Rectangle(0.0, 0.0, w * 1.0, h * 1.0)` inside the `drawer.isolateWithTarget()` session; * When saving the render target\\'s buffer to file via `rt.colorBuffer(0).saveToFile(...)` make sure to set `async= false`: this will deallocate resources that `.saveToFile` internally uses and avoid memory crash; * If you use a fragment shader inside shadestyle, do not use `c_boundsPosition` for your normalized coordinates, but rather pass a resolution variable containing the resolution, for instance `parameter(\"resolution\", Vector2(w * 1.0, h * 1.0))`, and define your normalized coordinates via `c_screenPosition/p_resolution` (in case, make sure you obtain the correct aspect ratio by scaling the `uv` variable). The last point was fairly tricky to realize, and this happened after chasing a weird visual effect and some testing. :slight_smile:', [])",

          "('Hey Abe, Thanks for getting in touch! Good that you ask, it\\'s actually quite a useful Kotlin feature when writing OPENRNDR sketches. I\\'m happy to share how I use it! This feature was added in Kotlin 1.6.20 as a prototype so needs to be explicitly enabled in the build file ``` tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> { kotlinOptions.freeCompilerArgs += \"-Xcontext-receivers\" } ``` It allows us to add another context to a function. In other words, it adds another `this` to the function. So, besides the implicit `this` receiver from the containing class, there is another `this` coming from the context we provided. Note that `this.` can be omitted in unambiguous cases, which is still the case for both. For example, we can extract drawing logic outside of the OPENRNDR `program` block into another class. The following code makes `drawer` as well everything else from `Program` available in the `draw()` function. ``` class Figure( val shapeContour: ShapeContour ) { context(Program) fun draw() { drawer.strokeWeight = 2.0 drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.DARK_ORCHID drawer.contour(shapeContour) } ``` All we have to do then is to call the `draw` function from the scope where an instance of `Program` is available: ``` program { val figure = Figure(contour { ... }) // We are in the context of Program in this block // The instance of Program will be passed to draw function as a context receiver figure.draw() } ``` This example is a bit silly, we could as well just pass `drawer` to the `figure.draw()` function. It still helps to reduce the number of arguments which makes the code more readable. Another way to use it is to combine it with Kotlin\\'s `with` function: ``` // In a separate class/file class AnotherClass { context(Drawer) fun draw() { clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) isolated { translate(bounds.center) circles(...) } } } ------------------------------------ // In OPENRNDR application program { with(drawer) { anotherClass.draw() } } ``` Notice that in this example, we don\\'t need to write `drawer.` before all function calls because an instance of Drawer (as well as an instance of `AnotherClass`) are both available as `this` inside that function. This helps to reduce boilerplate code even further. If there is a conflict (a function is called that exists in both context receivers), the local class has priority. We can also specify which receiver we want to use: ``` this@Drawer.contour(...) ``` You can find a lot more detail about it here: https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/context-receivers.md or just search for \"Kotlin Context Receivers\" I like to structure my code in classes, so I use this to extract drawing logic to different classes and files outside the `program` or `extend` blocks of OPENRNDR application without the need to pass the context through multiple layers as arguments. I\\'m still at the very beginning of my journey with OPENRNDR, so the code you found is quite basic and not very well structured (these Faces were actually my very first OPENRNDR sketch! :grin:).

For example, say i want to render 10 circles and 10 squares. I would like to write code inside ``` fun main() = application { program { extend { renderSquares(10, size, color, etc) renderCircles(10, size, color, etc) ``` Now if i would like to do that (atleast when i tried to do it), i would have to send renderCircles(this) \"this\" parameter to do that and later have to do something like this.application.program.extend.

          "(\"Thanks for the swift reply. I think render targets might be the right thing I'm looking for. I'll still explain what my goal is in more detail though: Application A renders Canvas A on the full width and height of the application window. Canvas A displays data received from user input. When user presses a button, Canvas B renders a data visualization of the user input. That data visualization is displayed in the corner of the application window with a size of width/4 and height/4. Then an external printer prints out what is displayed on Canvas B. Another way to describe it is: Imaging you took a screenshot on you phone and a preview of what you took displays itself on the bottom corner of your screen. Instead of the preview being an exact replica of your screen it is a bar graph of the sum of all R, G, and B values from all of the pixels of the image on your screen. My rationalization for the separate canvases is because I want to avoid rendering the Canvas B image twice (once for the print preview and another for the actual printing process). I figured its easier to render it once and feed the printer the color buffer of Canvas B. ***Edit**:* I actually got it working a bit before I saw your reply. Its kind of what Im looking for, but I still have a few questions. Heres my code: PrintState.kt ``` class PrintState (program: Program){ val appProgram = program val appWidth = appProgram.width val appHeight = appProgram.height val rt = renderTarget(600, 400){ colorBuffer() depthBuffer() } fun renderPrintout (drawer: Drawer){ drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt){ drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.RED drawer.rectangle(40.0,40.0, rt.width-40.0, 60.0) drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.BLUE drawer.rectangle(rt.width-40.0, rt.height-40.0, 80.0,80.0) drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.GREEN drawer.rectangle(rt.width-40.0, rt.height-40.0, 40.0,40.0) drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.BLACK drawer.rectangle(rt.width+40.0, rt.height+40.0, 40.0,40.0) } drawer.image(rt.colorBuffer(0)) } fun draw(drawer: Drawer){ drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.LIGHT_SEA_GREEN) renderPrintout(drawer) } } ``` Main.kt ``` fun main() { application { configure { width = 1400 height = 800 } program { val pS = PrintState(program) extend { pS.draw(drawer) } } } } ``` And my output ![Screen Shot 2023-03-10 at 10.31.35 AM|690x404](upload://q7qb6vF4l0MPKXDQE2tkGzbNzzB.png) As demonstrated by the blue square and the black square, the render target will render items that are out of its buffer width and height. So whats the point of declaring them? Something that I noticed is that the render target always has its origin at the top left of the application. Is there a way to set it anywhere else besides there? Or would it be simpler to use a transformation?\", ['\\nclass PrintState (program: Program){\\n    val appProgram = program\\n    val appWidth = appProgram.width\\n    val appHeight = appProgram.height\\n    val rt = renderTarget(600, 400){\\n        colorBuffer()\\n        depthBuffer()\\n    }\\n    fun renderPrintout (drawer: Drawer){\\n        drawer.isolatedWithTarget(rt){\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.RED\\n            drawer.rectangle(40.0,40.0, rt.width-40.0, 60.0)\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.BLUE\\n            drawer.rectangle(rt.width-40.0, rt.height-40.0, 80.0,80.0)\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.GREEN\\n            drawer.rectangle(rt.width-40.0, rt.height-40.0, 40.0,40.0)\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.BLACK\\n            drawer.rectangle(rt.width+40.0, rt.height+40.0, 40.0,40.0)\\n        }\\n        drawer.image(rt.colorBuffer(0))\\n    }\\n\\n    fun draw(drawer: Drawer){\\n        drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.LIGHT_SEA_GREEN)\\n        renderPrintout(drawer)\\n\\n    }\\n}\\n', '\\nfun main() {\\n    application {\\n        configure {\\n            width = 1400\\n            height = 800\\n        }\\n        program {\\n            val pS = PrintState(program)\\n            extend {\\n                pS.draw(drawer)\\n\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",

Being able to view all the thumbnails at once can be useful, which is not always easy if we only have SVG files. Fortunately Inkscape can be executed from the command line to create PNG images. ``` for f in *.svg inkscape $f --export-area-drawing --export-background=white --export-overwrite --export-margin=10 -w 300 --export-type=png -o $f.png end ``` This script works on my Linux box with Fish shell, but it should be easy to adapt to other OSes. The `-w` argument specifies the width in pixels, but you could leave this out, or specify a DPI or height value. Once you have those PNG images you could use image magick if you want to create contact sheets. ``` magick montage *png -tile 10x6 -geometry 200x200+10+10 -pointsize 9 -set label '%f' /tmp/all_%d.png ``` In my case it creates six and this is the second one: ![all_2|690x440](upload://A8XlnukHVUIXzFDKCcbkQlOuYq.jpeg) Since the generated SVG files have the name of the program which created them, now I can easily browse these contact sheets, find a thumbnail I like, look at its filename, then open that Kotlin program and iterate on it. Not really an OPENRNDR tip, but it can be useful if you are creating many vector files for your pen plotter.\", ['\\nfor f in *.svg\\n    inkscape $f --export-area-drawing --export-background=white --export-overwrite --export-margin=10 -w 300 --export-type=png -o $f.png\\nend\\n', \"\\nmagick montage *png -tile 10x6 -geometry 200x200+10+10 -pointsize 9 -set label '%f' /tmp/all_%d.png\\n\"])",

          "('# 7. Reduce pen up/down movements ### Also: \"how to clone a List\" In OPENRNDR, `Shape` objects are made out of `ShapeContour`s which are made out of `Segment`s. A `Segment` can be linear or a quadratic (one control point) or cubic (two control points) Bezier curves. I often generate designs to plot that have many `ShapeContour`s or `Segment`s. The most time-costly operation with a device like the Axidraw is raising and lowering the pen. Therefore it\\'s tempting to make designs with one huge complex `ShapeContour` instead of thousands of `ShapeContour`s or `Segment`s. But sometimes we can\\'t choose. The tip I\\'m going to describe here applies to collections of `Segment`s in which consecutive ones often start where the previous one ended. This assumes a sorted list. If the list is not sorted, that\\'s a harder problem in which one needs to search for `Segment`s that start or end in the same locations. I ran into this situation when scanning positions on a `Segment` pixel by pixel comparing pixel colors in an invisible ColorBuffer (to have an image affect the design). So one simple program to concatenate `Segment`s may look like this: ```kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.shape.Circle import org.openrndr.shape.Segment import org.openrndr.shape.ShapeContour fun main() = application { // A bunch of segments, this would actually be a generative // design of some kind made out of tons of segments. // We simulate such a design with just 3 circles broken into // their segments val segments = List(3) { Circle(100.0 + it * 100.0, 200.0, 30.0).contour.segments }.flatten() val bucket = mutableListOf<Segment>() val result = mutableListOf<ShapeContour>() segments.forEach { if(bucket.isEmpty() || bucket.last().end.squaredDistanceTo(it.start) < 10E-6) { bucket.add(it) } else { result.add(ShapeContour(bucket.toMutableList(), false)) bucket.clear() bucket.add(it) } } result.add(ShapeContour(bucket, false)) println(\"We went from ${segments.size} pen up/down movements to ${result.size}.\") program { extend { drawer.fill = null drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE drawer.contours(result) } } } ``` It\\'s a very simple program that reconstructs the original ShapeContour\\'s out of a list of segments. In this case it wasn\\'t necessary, because we could have avoided breaking up the `ShapeContour`s in the first place. Gotcha: the only tricky part is to call `.toMutableList()` to produce a clone of the list. If we don\\'t do that, the references to previous `ShapeContour`s get overwritten with the later ones, and we would obtain a list with the same circle 3 times. To see what I mean, try deleting `.toMutableList()` and observe the result. Running the program will print ``` We went from 12 pen up/down movements to 3. ``` Note: the Inkscape Axidraw driver has an optimizer. What it does is to sort the segments to avoid unnecessary 2D movement, but it does not avoid pen up/down movements (at least last time I tried during 2022).', ['kotlin\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.Circle\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.Segment\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.ShapeContour\\n\\nfun main() = application {\\n    // A bunch of segments, this would actually be a generative \\n    // design of some kind made out of tons of segments.\\n    // We simulate such a design with just 3 circles broken into\\n    // their segments\\n    val segments = List(3) {\\n        Circle(100.0 + it * 100.0, 200.0, 30.0).contour.segments\\n    }.flatten()\\n\\n    val bucket = mutableListOf<Segment>()\\n    val result = mutableListOf<ShapeContour>()\\n\\n    segments.forEach {\\n        if(bucket.isEmpty() || bucket.last().end.squaredDistanceTo(it.start) < 10E-6) {\\n            bucket.add(it)\\n        } else {\\n            result.add(ShapeContour(bucket.toMutableList(), false))\\n            bucket.clear()\\n            bucket.add(it)\\n        }\\n    }\\n    result.add(ShapeContour(bucket, false))\\n\\n    println(\"We went from ${segments.size} pen up/down movements to ${result.size}.\")\\n\\n    program {\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.fill = null\\n            drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE\\n            drawer.contours(result)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', '\\nWe went from 12 pen up/down movements to 3.\\n'])",

Note: In this program I used a function I called `circleish()` but you can replace it by `Circle()` to have regular circles instead. I\\'ll explain two lines of this program. The first one is ``` val allPoints = LineSegment(Vector2.ZERO, drawer.bounds.dimensions) .sub(0.1, 0.9).contour.equidistantPositions(20) ``` It creates a straight line segment that goes from top-left to bottom right of the canvas. Another way to write the same would be `LineSegment(0.0, 0.0, width.toDouble(), height.toDouble())` but I prefer to use `Vector2`s because there\\'s so many things you can do with them in OPENRNDR (pass them to methods, query information about them, do arithmetic operations, etc). From that `Segment` I obtain a shorter sub-segment that goes from 10% to 90% of the original length because I want to leave some margin and avoid the line starting and ending on the edges of the window. Next I convert it to a `ShapeContour` because `ShapeContour` provides a bunch of interesting methods, for example `equidistantPositions()` which returns a list of Vector2. Now I can use this list of positions in the `.circles()` method to draw many circles. The second line I wanted to describe is ``` val insidePoints = allPoints.filter { it in shp } ``` which creates a subset of `allPoints`, specifically, the ones that are inside `shp`. Very short, right? :) ### Why write code inside `program {}` but before `extends {}` ? Code outside the `extends {}` block runs just once instead of once per animation frame. Inside `program` I already have access to `drawer.bounds`, `width`, `height`, `drawer`, etc. which I may need to lay out things relative to the canvas. I could as well do all calculations inside `extend { ... }`, but then the program would be recalculating everything on every animation frame. With simple programs like this it does not make much of a difference but I often create designs that take up to a minute to generate and I wouldn\\'t want to recreate such designs again and again keeping my CPU usage at 100%.

Deduplicating segments When plotting the `REVERSE_DIFFERENCE` example above we might have a small issue: let's open it in Inkscape and move the shapes a bit: ![image|679x339](upload://aQfbFgs8fM4S5mYcGJ8Ghu5LyX.png) The issue is that we have repeated lines. This is not an issue when showing the design on the screen, but when plotting, some lines are plotted twice. This will make plotting slower and some lines may look darker than others. No big deal with 3 circles, but with complex designs it does make a difference. To get around this issue I wrote a simple function called `.dedupe()`. Using it couldn't be easier: call the method before saving the file like this: `svg.dedupe().saveToFile(file)` Here's the source code for `Composition.dedupe()` and for the required `Segment.contains()`: ```kotlin /** * For a Composition, filter out bezier segments contained in longer bezier segments. * The goal is to avoid drawing lines multiple times with a plotter. */ fun Composition.dedupe(err: Double = 1.0): Composition { val segments = this.findShapes().flatMap { it.shape.contours.flatMap { contour -> contour.segments } } val deduped = mutableListOf<Segment>() segments.forEach { curr -> if (deduped.none { other -> other.contains(curr, err) }) { deduped.add(curr) } } return drawComposition { contours(deduped.map { it.contour }) } } ``` ```kotlin /** * Simple test to see if a segment contains a different Segment. * Compares start, end and two points at 1/3 and 2/3. * Returns false when comparing a Segment to itself. */ fun Segment.contains(other: Segment, error: Double = 0.5): Boolean = this !== other && this.on(other.start, error) != null && this.on(other.end, error) != null && this.on(other.position(1.0 / 3), error) != null && this.on(other.position(2.0 / 3), error) != null ``` It probably doesn't cover every case but maybe it helps someone?\", ['kotlin\\n/**\\n * For a Composition, filter out bezier segments contained in longer bezier segments.\\n * The goal is to avoid drawing lines multiple times with a plotter.\\n */\\nfun Composition.dedupe(err: Double = 1.0): Composition {\\n    val segments = this.findShapes().flatMap {\\n        it.shape.contours.flatMap { contour -> contour.segments }\\n    }\\n    val deduped = mutableListOf<Segment>()\\n    segments.forEach { curr ->\\n        if (deduped.none { other -> other.contains(curr, err) }) {\\n            deduped.add(curr)\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return drawComposition {\\n        contours(deduped.map { it.contour })\\n    }\\n}\\n', 'kotlin\\n/**\\n * Simple test to see if a segment contains a different Segment.\\n * Compares start, end and two points at 1/3 and 2/3.\\n * Returns false when comparing a Segment to itself.\\n */\\nfun Segment.contains(other: Segment, error: Double = 0.5): Boolean =\\n    this !== other &&\\n            this.on(other.start, error) != null &&\\n            this.on(other.end, error) != null &&\\n            this.on(other.position(1.0 / 3), error) != null &&\\n            this.on(other.position(2.0 / 3), error) != null\\n\\n'])",

By the way, this is using `IntVector2` taken from the original vertices rounded with 0 decimals and then `vec2.toInt()`. If I use `Vector2` all the way then very few shapes are detected. I assume it\\'s because there\\'s no threshold used when comparing Vector2s. Maybe I can specify a custom comparator with JGraphT... [read this](https://jgrapht.org/guide/UserOverview#graph-comparisons). ps. I think I found the reason for (1): > Note that Paton\\'s algorithm produces a fundamental cycle basis while this implementation produces a [weakly fundamental cycle basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_space#Fundamental_and_weakly_fundamental_bases). A cycle basis is called *weakly fundamental* if there exists a linear ordering of the cycles in a cycle basis **such that each cycle includes at least one edge that is not part of any previous cycle**. (emphasis mine). So I need to find the right algorithm. One in which you can specify the desired cycle length would be great as I assume it would be a good optimization: stop searching if the cycle grows too long. And what is needed seems to be \"finding all chordless cycles\" in the graph.

What the code does is this: select all the even vertices and displace them following the curve normal at that point by 20 pixels. The `true` argument is the default which makes it update the control points next to each vertex. By default a Circle only has 4 segments. I wanted to have a circle with more segments so I wrote the following: ```kotlin /** * Returns a modified ShapeContour in which segments have been split into [subdivisions] parts. * The new contour should be visually identical to the original. */ fun ShapeContour.resample(subdivisions: Int): ShapeContour { require(subdivisions >= 2) { \"subdivisions must be >= 2 but is actually $subdivisions\" } return ShapeContour( segments.map { seg -> List(subdivisions) { val t = it / subdivisions.toDouble() seg.sub(t, t + 1.0 / subdivisions) } }.flatten(), closed ) } ``` Now we can play a bit.

The variables `w` and `h` I mainly use in relation to [this](https://openrndr.discourse.group/t/screenrecorder-and-cropping-videos/468/8) to make higher resolution images. Probably a good idea would also be to have something like `map(0, w, 0, img.width, x * 1.0).toInt()` and the correspective for `y` when accessing the shadow. It would still be left to the user to adjust the aspect ratio of the final resulting canvas, but one could achieve larger designs.

Meanwhile, I tried making some changes to the second program to make it look closer to the first one, but I don\\'t know if I got it right: [details=\"imports\"] ```kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.color.rgb import org.openrndr.draw.isolated import org.openrndr.extra.compositor.* import org.openrndr.extra.fx.blend.Add import org.openrndr.extra.fx.distort.Perturb import org.openrndr.math.IntVector2 import org.openrndr.shape.Circle import org.openrndr.shape.contour import kotlin.math.cos ``` [/details] ```kotlin fun main() = application { configure { width = 800 height = 800 position = IntVector2(1920 / 2, 20) } oliveProgram { val c = contour { moveTo(0.0, 0.0) curveTo(100.0, 0.0, 200.0, 70.0) continueTo(50.0, 20.0) continueTo(50.0, 70.0) continueTo(30.0, 20.0) lineTo(30.0, 0.0) lineTo(100.0, 0.0) curveTo(0.0, 30.0, 0.0, 0.0) close() } val composite = compose { draw { drawer.fill = rgb(0.0, 0.1, 0.6) drawer.circle(Circle(width / 2.0, height / 2.0, 350.0)) } layer { blend(Add()) { clip = true } draw { drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE for (y in 0 until 50) { for (x in 0 until 50) { val o: Double = cos(seconds) * 0.35 + x / 0.01 - y * 0.01 drawer.isolated { translate(x * 11.0, y * 50.0) contour(c.sub(o, o + 0.023)) } } } } post(Perturb()) { phase = cos(seconds) * 0.5 decay = 0.168 gain = cos(seconds * 2) * 0.5 } } } extend { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) composite.draw(drawer) } } } ``` Did I get it close? Maybe `post()` can help? Other ideas: * `rgb()` can be used, shorter than `ColorRGBa()` * Why the large `strokeWeight` instead of a fill? To draw a ring maybe? Not sure if they look or perform differently. * For better performance I would avoid calling `isolatedWithTarget` 2500 times. Instead we can call it once and put both loops inside it, then inside the loops: ```kotlin drawer.isolated { translate(x * 11.0, y * 50.0) contour(c.sub(o, o + 0.023)) } ``` * No need to update the filter settings many times if it\\'s being applied just once. Maybe better like this? ```kotlin filter.run { phase = cos(seconds) * 0.5 decay = 0.168 gain = cos(seconds * 2) * 0.5 apply(unfiltered.colorBuffer(0), filtered.colorBuffer(0)) } ``` I guess one can arrive less optimized code when experimenting while live coding :) I\\'ve been there. ps. Was it meant to be `x / 0.01` or `x * 0.01`?

          "('Thank you for this. I mentioned in a different thread I\\'m interested in generating SVGs for use with a pen plotter. I\\'d like to find development patterns I can use to be more intentional in how paths layer on top of each other since a pen plotter will plot everything with an outline even if its otherwise occluded or drawn over. Today my workflow involves post processing with vector drawing programs (Inkscape and Illustrator) where I will clean up some overdraws or restack things by hand. This quickly becomes tedious. I was aware of OPENRNDRs boolean ops but they all fell short of what I needed. REVERSE_DIFFERENCE is a new mode that I was not aware of, it seems to have been added just three weeks ago and is not part of the 3.44 release. Anyway I gave it a try and it works just like Illustrator\\'s \"Trim\" pathfinding operation which is pretty much all I use Illustrator for so this is a great addition. However it still does have one problem (AI\\'s Trim also shares). When the shapes are split, new edges are created to close up the shapes, the edges are still stacked on each other. ![Screen Shot 2021-01-09 at 4.12.43 PM|366x320](upload://ApPoyjFSXI8i7y7pfjfa2GS7jOn.png) As you can see, I moved the right grey circle away from the pink shape, the shared edges are overlapping. I like to use a lot of colors in my plots and lets say I outlined the pink shape with a dark color and then outlined the grey circle with a lighter color, the dark color would show through on the overlapping parts. I can work around this by carefully choosing colors and draw order but I\\'m a programmer and I can\\'t help think there is a way to do this in code vs by hand. I had some thoughts of trying to keep metadata about drawing layers and then walking through the whole shape tree before writing my SVG and splitting paths at whatever points another higher-in-stack path covers it. Basically, flattening the composition to only parts that are viewable. I might end up with a ton of really short paths but its a start. Please suggest alternatives if you have ideas! Again, thanks for the post and showing me REVERSE_DIFFERENCE, it already saved me a ton of time on plots where color layering isn\\'t too important.', [])",

Find the contour-point nearest to another point ![2021-03-06-121214_388x352_scrot|388x352](upload://yIxpcC6GiDBZ8EmA8OzJKzFEmqe.png) One aspect we can consider when generating a design to plot is this: do previously added lines and curves influence the properties of the line or curve I will add next? Personally I find it most interesting when curves interact with other curves, when lines start or end at other lines, or cross them at specified locations or angles, or when something happens at the intersections of lines. OPENRNDR offers many tools (methods) to help with this. We can query distances, intersections, normals, we can offset curves, create sub-curves, sample them at various locations and much more. In this post I will just mention one of such tools: `ShapeContour.nearest(point: Vector2)`. With it we can ask: what point in this contour is the closest to this other point? ```kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.shape.Circle import org.openrndr.shape.LineSegment fun main() { application { program { // create two nested circles positioned relative to the canvas // Circle is a \"mathematical circle\" (a data type) // `.contour` converts it into a drawable one. val c1 = Circle(drawer.bounds.position(0.45, 0.45), 150.0).contour val c2 = Circle(drawer.bounds.position(0.55, 0.55), 50.0).contour // Create a list with 60 LineSegments. Each one connects // a position sampled from the first circle with the nearest // point in the second circle. val lineCount = 60 val lines = List(lineCount) { val a = c1.position(it / lineCount.toDouble()) // 0.0 .. 1.0 val b = c2.nearest(a).position LineSegment(a, b) } extend { drawer.apply { // make `this` = drawer clear(ColorRGBa.WHITE) fill = null stroke = ColorRGBa.BLACK contour(c1) contour(c2) lineSegments(lines) } } } } } ``` Another result using the same approach: ![2021-03-06-121824_413x356_scrot|402x348](upload://849gYCDtf0eNRg7kG0SCXg89Ro1.png) [More about Shape, ShapeContour and Segment](https://guide.openrndr.org/drawingBasics/complexShapes.html)', ['kotlin\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.Circle\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.LineSegment\\n\\nfun main() {\\n    application {\\n        program {\\n            // create two nested circles positioned relative to the canvas\\n            // Circle is a \"mathematical circle\" (a data type)\\n           //  `.contour` converts it into a drawable one.\\n            val c1 = Circle(drawer.bounds.position(0.45, 0.45), 150.0).contour\\n            val c2 = Circle(drawer.bounds.position(0.55, 0.55), 50.0).contour\\n\\n            // Create a list with 60 LineSegments.

I guess it's not ideal to apply those transformations in real time, but works if you prepare a bunch of shapes when the program starts.

Note: if you are wondering where do `start` and `end` come from in the OPENRNDR example, note that the context of the `.intersections()` function is the `LineSegment` class, which luckily has properties called `start` and `end`. ### Using IntelliJ Idea In the past, if I needed a function, I would first write the function and only then use it. Now I do it the other way around: I first write the function call including the desired arguments. Idea will highlight it as an error and, by pressing Alt+Enter, it will suggest to create that function. This not only works for a a typical function call like `add(person1, person2)` but also for generating operator overloading functions, like `person1 + person2` or even `person1.add(person2)`. In all these cases the IDE suggests adding something that will make the code compile. That is how I generated the `LineSegment.intersections()` function: I typed `line.intersections(cir)` and Idea created the empty function which I then populated. :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=%22Processing%22%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['\\nimport java.util.List;\\n', '\\nPVector p0 = new PVector(100.0, 100.0);\\nPVector p1 = new PVector(400.0, 400.0);\\nfloat circleRadius = 90.0;\\n\\nvoid settings() {\\n  size(640, 480);\\n}\\n\\nvoid draw() {\\n  background(255);\\n  fill(#FFAA00, 100);\\n  stroke(0, 100);\\n  strokeWeight(2);\\n  \\n  PVector circleCenter = new PVector(mouseX, mouseY);\\n  line(p0.x, p0.y, p1.x, p1.y);\\n  circle(circleCenter.x, circleCenter.y, circleRadius * 2);\\n\\n  List<PVector> intersections = intersections(p0, p1, circleCenter, circleRadius);\\n  for(PVector i : intersections) {\\n    circle(i.x, i.y, 10);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nList<PVector> intersections(PVector start, PVector end, PVector circleCenter, float radius) {\\n  PVector d = PVector.sub(end, start);\\n  PVector f = PVector.sub(start, circleCenter);\\n  \\n  List<PVector> result = new ArrayList<PVector>();\\n\\n  float a = d.dot(d);\\n  float b = 2 * f.dot( d );\\n  float c = f.dot(f) - radius * radius;\\n\\n  float discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;\\n  if ( discriminant < 0 ) {\\n    return result;\\n  } \\n\\n  discriminant = sqrt(discriminant);\\n\\n  float t1 = (-b - discriminant) / (2 * a);\\n  float t2 = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a);\\n\\n  if (t1 >= 0 && t1 <= 1) {\\n    result.add(PVector.lerp(start, end, t1));\\n  }\\n\\n  if (t2 >= 0 && t2 <= 1) {\\n    result.add(PVector.lerp(start, end, t2));\\n  }    \\n\\n  return result;\\n}\\n', '\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.Circle\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.LineSegment\\nimport kotlin.math.sqrt\\n', '\\nfun main() = application {\\n    program {\\n        val line = LineSegment(100.0, 100.0, 400.0, 400.0)\\n        var cir = Circle(Vector2.ZERO, 90.0)\\n\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.WHITE)\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.fromHex(\"FFAA00\").opacify(0.4)\\n            drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.BLACK.opacify(0.4)\\n            drawer.strokeWeight = 2.0\\n\\n            cir = cir.movedTo(mouse.position)\\n            drawer.lineSegment(line)\\n            drawer.circle(cir)\\n            drawer.circles(line.intersections(cir), 10.0)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nprivate fun LineSegment.intersections(cir: Circle): List<Vector2> {\\n    val d = end - start\\n    val f = start - cir.center\\n\\n    val result = mutableListOf<Vector2>()\\n\\n    val a = d.dot(d)\\n    val b = 2 * f.dot(d)\\n    val c = f.dot(f) - cir.radius * cir.radius\\n\\n    var discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c\\n    if (discriminant < 0) {\\n        return result\\n    }\\n\\n    discriminant = sqrt(discriminant)\\n\\n    val t1 = (-b - discriminant) / (2 * a)\\n    val t2 = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\\n\\n    if (t1 in 0.0..1.0) {\\n        result.add(mix(start, end, t1))\\n    }\\n\\n    if (t2 in 0.0..1.0) {\\n        result.add(mix(start, end, t2))\\n    }\\n\\n    return result\\n}\\n'])",

For example, write a program that creates a basic design, then a second one that applies an effect to the output of the first program. If you have several such effects you can experiment with applying them in different order, or with different parameters, etc. An example of such an SVG altering effect can look like this: ```kotlin // load svg val original = loadSVG(\"my_generative.svg\").findShapes().map { it.shape } // some kind of contour I will use to cut and bend my svg file val knife = contour { ... } // process all the contours from the original file using .split() val cutLines = original.flatMap { it.contours // get contours from shapes }.flatMap { split(it, knife) // For the image below I also apply .bend(), not shown } // make a new svg with the modified contours val modified = drawComposition { fill = null stroke = ColorRGBa.BLACK contours(cutLines) } // save result saveFileDialog(supportedExtensions = listOf(\"SVG\" to listOf(\"svg\"))) { it.writeText(writeSVG(modified)) } ``` That\\'s the approach I used to produce this design: ![2021-02-26-190417_694x487_scrot|690x484](upload://vpUyrDFFgqPTU5rcgfFnCXoYEpV.png) One program produced the base design, a second one was used for cutting and bending segments.', ['kotlin\\n// load svg\\nval original = loadSVG(\"my_generative.svg\").findShapes().map { it.shape }\\n\\n// some kind of contour I will use to cut and bend my svg file\\nval knife = contour { ... }\\n\\n// process all the contours from the original file using .split()\\nval cutLines = original.flatMap {\\n    it.contours // get contours from shapes\\n}.flatMap {\\n    split(it, knife) // For the image below I also apply .bend(), not shown\\n}\\n\\n// make a new svg with the modified contours\\nval modified = drawComposition {\\n    fill = null\\n    stroke = ColorRGBa.BLACK\\n    contours(cutLines)\\n}\\n\\n// save result\\nsaveFileDialog(supportedExtensions = listOf(\"SVG\" to listOf(\"svg\"))) {\\n    it.writeText(writeSVG(modified))\\n}\\n'])",

The inner lines could be short or long, straight or curved, open or closed and arranged randomly, in a regular pattern, with equal or varying separation between them. Endless possibilities. The most important part might be the `drawComposition` with `ClipMode.INTERSECT` which is used to eliminate anything that is outside of the `cutterShape`. An idea for you: create a collection of hatching functions with arguments to control the output.

That set contains white twice to make it more frequent. ![p5.P06_loopsrandom-2020-04-08-22.48.57|690x345](upload://aim49ohYxdDtM2h8LaCMfpQb31K.png) ### Processing / Java ``` import java.util.Arrays; int seed = 1111; int PINK = #FFC0CB; int WHITE = #FFFFFF; int BLACK = #000000; ArrayList<Integer> colors = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList( PINK, WHITE, WHITE, color(PINK, 128))); void setup() { size(900, 450); } void draw() { randomSeed(seed); background(WHITE); for (int x=0; x<=15; x++) { for (int y=0; y<=5; y++) { PVector pos = new PVector( map(x, 0, 15, 100, width - 100), map(y, 0, 5, 100, height - 100) ); stroke(PINK, 102); float amount = noise(pos.x * 0.007, pos.y * 0.004) * 3 - 0.7; fill(amount > 1 ? lerpColor(PINK, WHITE, amount-1) : lerpColor(PINK, BLACK, 1-amount)); circle(pos.x, pos.y, 40); if (random(1) < 0.5) { fill(colors.get((int)random(colors.size()))); circle(pos.x, pos.y, 20); } } } } ``` ### OPENRNDR / Kotlin [details=\"Imports\"] ``` // imports are added automatically by the IDE import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random import org.openrndr.math.Vector2 import org.openrndr.math.map ``` [/details] ``` fun main() = application { configure { width = 900 height = 450 } program { val colors = listOf(ColorRGBa.PINK, ColorRGBa.WHITE, ColorRGBa.WHITE, ColorRGBa.PINK.shade(0.5)) extend { Random.resetState() drawer.background(ColorRGBa.WHITE) for (x in 0..15) { for (y in 0..5) { val pos = Vector2( map(0.0, 15.0, 100.0, width - 100.0, x * 1.0), map(0.0, 5.0, 100.0, height - 100.0, y * 1.0) ) drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.PINK.opacify(0.4) val amount = Random.simplex(pos.x * 0.004, pos.y * 0.003) + 0.5 drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.PINK.shade(amount) drawer.circle(pos, 20.0) if (Random.bool()) { drawer.fill = Random.pick(colors) drawer.circle(pos, 10.0) } } } } } } ``` Concept | Processing | OPENRNDR --- | --- | --- flip a coin | `random(1) < 0.5` | `Random.bool()` pick a random item from a list | `colors.get( (int)random(colors.size()))` | `Random.pick(colors)` reset the random number generator | `randomSeed(value); //noiseSeed(value);` | `Random.resetState()` or `Random.seed = \"capybara\"` get a random noise value | `noise(x, y)` | `Random.perlin(x, y)` or `Random.simplex(x, y)` or `Random.value(x, y)` and [even more](https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-noise) count from 0 to 15 | `for(int x=0; x<=15; x++)` <br> `for(int x=0; x<16; x++)` <br>. | `for(x in 0..15)` <br> `for(x in 0 until 16)` <br> `(0..15).foreach` get a translucent variation of a color | `fill(PINK, alpha)` | `ColorRGBa.PINK.opacify(0.4)` get brighter or darker variation of a color | `if(amount > 1) lerpColorPINK, WHITE, amount-1) else lerpColor(BLACK, PINK, amount)` | `ColorRGBa.PINK.shade(amount)` Notes: Different noise values are used to achieve similar color shades in both programs. Noise functions and their arguments produce different aesthetics, so you just need to play with the values to get what you want. By resetting the random seed I avoid a flickering animation, because I obtain the same sequence of random numbers on each frame. But if you want it to flicker remove the `randomSeed()` / `Random.resetState()` :) :point_down: Share your questions and comments below | :mag_right: [Find other OPENRNDR & Processing posts](https://openrndr.discourse.group/search?q=Processing%20%23openrndr%3Atutorials)', ['\\nimport java.util.Arrays;\\nint seed = 1111;\\nint PINK = #FFC0CB;\\nint WHITE = #FFFFFF;\\nint BLACK = #000000;\\nArrayList<Integer> colors = new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(\\n  PINK, WHITE, WHITE, color(PINK, 128)));\\n\\nvoid setup() {\\n  size(900, 450);\\n}\\n\\nvoid draw() {\\n  randomSeed(seed);\\n  background(WHITE);\\n  for (int x=0; x<=15; x++) {\\n    for (int y=0; y<=5; y++) {\\n      PVector pos = new PVector(\\n        map(x, 0, 15, 100, width - 100), \\n        map(y, 0, 5, 100, height - 100)\\n        );\\n      stroke(PINK, 102);\\n      float amount = noise(pos.x * 0.007, pos.y * 0.004) * 3 - 0.7;\\n      fill(amount > 1 ? lerpColor(PINK, WHITE, amount-1) : \\n                        lerpColor(PINK, BLACK, 1-amount));\\n      circle(pos.x, pos.y, 40);\\n      if (random(1) < 0.5) {\\n        fill(colors.get((int)random(colors.size())));\\n        circle(pos.x, pos.y, 20);\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n', '\\n// imports are added automatically by the IDE\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.noise.Random\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\nimport org.openrndr.math.map\\n', '\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure {\\n        width = 900\\n        height = 450\\n    }\\n    program {\\n        val colors = listOf(ColorRGBa.PINK, ColorRGBa.WHITE,\\n                            ColorRGBa.WHITE, ColorRGBa.PINK.shade(0.5))\\n        extend {\\n            Random.resetState()\\n            drawer.background(ColorRGBa.WHITE)\\n            for (x in 0..15) {\\n                for (y in 0..5) {\\n                    val pos = Vector2(\\n                        map(0.0, 15.0, 100.0, width - 100.0, x * 1.0),\\n                        map(0.0, 5.0, 100.0, height - 100.0, y * 1.0)\\n                    )\\n                    drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.PINK.opacify(0.4)\\n                    val amount = Random.simplex(pos.x * 0.004, pos.y * 0.003) + 0.5\\n                    drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.PINK.shade(amount)\\n                    drawer.circle(pos, 20.0)\\n                    if (Random.bool()) {\\n                        drawer.fill = Random.pick(colors)\\n                        drawer.circle(pos, 10.0)\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\n'])",

Two things would make it easier: 1. Declare these before `fun main()` to make it more obvious they need to be adjusted. ``` private const val PATH_SILHOUETTE = \"/path/to/silhouette-image.png\" private const val PATH_COLOR = \"/path/to/color-image.png\" //... and use them below ... // val img = loadImage(PATH_SILHOUETTE) // val imgCol = loadImage(PATH_COLOR) ``` 2. Get the image sizes automatically to avoid errors when the images are smaller than expected. ``` import kotlin.math.min ... val w = min(img.width, imgCol.width) val h = min(img.height, imgCol.height) ``` Funny that this is how I got started with Kotlin and Processing, later with OPENRNDR :) I ported a [non-animated version](https://github.com/hamoid/openrndr-template/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/apps/p5/p09_circlePacking.kt) and there\\'s a [looong thread](https://discourse.processing.org/t/writing-processing-in-kotlin/3957) in the Processing forum.

Until it becomes part of a release building openrndr is necessary for it to work. Here a small program making use of the functions: ``` fun main() = application { program { val ground = loadOBJasVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-ground.obj\") val vtrees = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-vtrees.obj\") val htrees1 = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-htrees1.obj\") val htrees2 = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-htrees2.obj\") val camera = OrbitalCamera(Vector3.ONE * 5.0, Vector3.ZERO, 90.0, 0.1, 5000.0) val controls = OrbitalControls(camera) val tex = loadImage(\"data/tex.jpg\") // Improve texture quality tex.filterMag = MagnifyingFilter.LINEAR tex.filterMin = MinifyingFilter.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR // A style to render the texture on the ground plane val texShader = shadeStyle { fragmentTransform = \"x_fill = texture(p_tex, va_texCoord0);\" parameter(\"tex\", tex) } extend(camera) extend(controls) extend { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK) drawer.shadeStyle = texShader drawer.vertexBuffer(ground, DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLES) drawer.shadeStyle = null drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.CYAN drawer.vertexBuffer(vtrees, DrawPrimitive.LINES) drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.MAGENTA drawer.vertexBuffer(htrees1, DrawPrimitive.LINES) drawer.vertexBuffer(htrees2, DrawPrimitive.LINES) } } } ``` The content of the .obj file looks like this ``` # Blender 4.0.2 # www.blender.org mtllib sk-vtrees.mtl o MyBezierCurve v 1.274006 1.001017 -6.868662 v 1.274006 2.001017 -6.868662 l 1 2 o MyBezierCurve.001 v 2.144386 1.450704 -8.414247 v 2.144386 2.450704 -8.414247 l 3 4 ... ``` Sharing it in case it helps someone :-)', ['\\nfun loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(path: String): VertexBuffer {\\n    val vfPos = vertexFormat { position(3) }\\n    val lines = loadOBJasLines(path)\\n    val vb = vertexBuffer(vfPos, lines.size * 2)\\n    vb.put {\\n        lines.forEach {\\n            write(it.position(0.0))\\n            write(it.position(1.0))\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return vb\\n}\\n\\nfun loadOBJasLines(path: String): List<Path3D> {\\n    val f = File(path)\\n    val lines = f.readLines()\\n    val result = mutableListOf<Path3D>()\\n    val positions = mutableListOf<Vector3>()\\n    lines.forEach { line ->\\n        if (line.isNotEmpty()) {\\n            val tokens = line.split(Regex(\"[ |\\\\t]+\")).map { it.trim() }.filter { it.isNotEmpty() }\\n            if (tokens.isNotEmpty()) {\\n                when (tokens[0]) {\\n                    \"v\" -> positions += Vector3(tokens[1].toDouble(), tokens[2].toDouble(), tokens[3].toDouble())\\n\\n                    \"l\" -> {\\n                        val points = tokens.drop(1).map {\\n                            positions[it.toInt() - 1]\\n                        }\\n                        result.add(Path3D.fromPoints(points, false))\\n                    }\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return result\\n}\\n', '\\nfun main() = application {\\n    program {\\n        val ground = loadOBJasVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-ground.obj\")\\n        val vtrees = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-vtrees.obj\")\\n        val htrees1 = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-htrees1.obj\")\\n        val htrees2 = loadOBJasLinesVertexBuffer(\"data/sk-htrees2.obj\")\\n\\n        val camera = OrbitalCamera(Vector3.ONE * 5.0, Vector3.ZERO, 90.0, 0.1, 5000.0)\\n        val controls = OrbitalControls(camera)\\n\\n        val tex = loadImage(\"data/tex.jpg\")\\n        // Improve texture quality\\n        tex.filterMag = MagnifyingFilter.LINEAR\\n        tex.filterMin = MinifyingFilter.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR\\n        // A style to render the texture on the ground plane\\n        val texShader = shadeStyle {\\n            fragmentTransform = \"x_fill = texture(p_tex, va_texCoord0);\"\\n            parameter(\"tex\", tex)\\n        }\\n        extend(camera)\\n        extend(controls)\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.BLACK)\\n\\n            drawer.shadeStyle = texShader\\n            drawer.vertexBuffer(ground, DrawPrimitive.TRIANGLES)\\n            drawer.shadeStyle = null\\n\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.CYAN\\n            drawer.vertexBuffer(vtrees, DrawPrimitive.LINES)\\n\\n            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.MAGENTA\\n            drawer.vertexBuffer(htrees1, DrawPrimitive.LINES)\\n            drawer.vertexBuffer(htrees2, DrawPrimitive.LINES)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n', '\\n# Blender 4.0.2\\n# www.blender.org\\nmtllib sk-vtrees.mtl\\no MyBezierCurve\\nv 1.274006 1.001017 -6.868662\\nv 1.274006 2.001017 -6.868662\\nl 1 2\\no MyBezierCurve.001\\nv 2.144386 1.450704 -8.414247\\nv 2.144386 2.450704 -8.414247\\nl 3 4\\n...\\n'])",

If someone could enlighten me as to why this is happening and any potential solutions I would very much appreciate it! ![plumbob-flicker|554x500](upload://edXTw2tFDssfXiHgZpxiad9hjl2.gif) ``` import org.openrndr.PresentationMode import org.openrndr.Program import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.draw.DepthTestPass import org.openrndr.extra.olive.oliveProgram import org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.DARK_SEA_GREEN import org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.DIM_GRAY import org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.SEA_GREEN import org.openrndr.math.Vector2 import org.openrndr.math.Vector3 import org.openrndr.shape.contour import kotlin.math.PI import kotlin.math.sin fun main() = application { configure { width = 800 height = 800 } oliveProgram { extend { drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.DIM_GRAY) fun setup() { drawer.translate(0.0, 0.0, -400.0) drawer.perspective(90.0, 1.0, 1.0, -300.0) drawer.depthWrite = true drawer.depthTestPass = DepthTestPass.LESS_OR_EQUAL drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.DARK_SEA_GREEN drawer.strokeWeight = 5.0 drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.SEA_GREEN } val ratioAS = 0.866 val apothem = 100 val side = apothem/ratioAS val rectWidth = side val rectHeight = 80.0 val tempo = seconds * 0.5 for (num in (0..5)) { setup() val offset = (PI/3.0) * num drawer.translate( (sin(tempo + offset)) * apothem, 0.0, sin(tempo + (0.5 * PI) + offset) * 100.0) drawer.rotate( Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0), tempo * (360.0/(2.0* PI)) + (360.0 * (num/6.0)) ) drawer.rectangle( -(rectWidth/2.0), -(rectHeight/2.0), rectWidth, rectHeight ) drawer.strokeWeight = 5.0 val triangleWidth = rectWidth - drawer.strokeWeight drawer.translate(0.0, ((rectHeight + drawer.strokeWeight)/2.0)); drawer.rotate(Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), -28.0) val c = contour { moveTo(Vector2(-triangleWidth/2.0, 0.0)) lineTo(cursor + Vector2(triangleWidth, 0.0)) lineTo(cursor + Vector2(-triangleWidth/2.0, 200.0)) lineTo(anchor) close() } drawer.contour(c) drawer.defaults() } } } } ```\", ['\\nimport org.openrndr.PresentationMode\\nimport org.openrndr.Program\\nimport org.openrndr.application\\nimport org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa\\nimport org.openrndr.draw.DepthTestPass\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.olive.oliveProgram\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.DARK_SEA_GREEN\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.DIM_GRAY\\nimport org.openrndr.extra.color.presets.SEA_GREEN\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector2\\nimport org.openrndr.math.Vector3\\nimport org.openrndr.shape.contour\\nimport kotlin.math.PI\\nimport kotlin.math.sin\\n\\nfun main() = application {\\n    configure {\\n        width = 800\\n        height = 800\\n\\n    }\\n    oliveProgram {\\n\\n        extend {\\n            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.DIM_GRAY)\\n            fun setup() {\\n                drawer.translate(0.0, 0.0, -400.0)\\n                drawer.perspective(90.0, 1.0, 1.0, -300.0)\\n                drawer.depthWrite = true\\n                drawer.depthTestPass = DepthTestPass.LESS_OR_EQUAL\\n                drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.DARK_SEA_GREEN\\n                drawer.strokeWeight = 5.0\\n                drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.SEA_GREEN\\n            }\\n\\n            val ratioAS = 0.866\\n            val apothem = 100\\n            val side = apothem/ratioAS\\n            val rectWidth = side\\n            val rectHeight = 80.0\\n\\n            val tempo = seconds * 0.5\\n\\n            for (num in (0..5)) {\\n                setup()\\n                val offset = (PI/3.0) * num\\n                drawer.translate(\\n                    (sin(tempo + offset)) * apothem,\\n                    0.0,\\n                    sin(tempo + (0.5 * PI) + offset) * 100.0)\\n                drawer.rotate(\\n                    Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0),\\n                    tempo * (360.0/(2.0* PI)) + (360.0 * (num/6.0))\\n                )\\n\\n                drawer.rectangle(\\n                    -(rectWidth/2.0),\\n                    -(rectHeight/2.0),\\n                    rectWidth,\\n                    rectHeight\\n                )\\n                drawer.strokeWeight = 5.0\\n                val triangleWidth = rectWidth - drawer.strokeWeight\\n                drawer.translate(0.0, ((rectHeight + drawer.strokeWeight)/2.0));\\n                drawer.rotate(Vector3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), -28.0)\\n                val c = contour {\\n                    moveTo(Vector2(-triangleWidth/2.0, 0.0))\\n                    lineTo(cursor + Vector2(triangleWidth, 0.0))\\n                    lineTo(cursor + Vector2(-triangleWidth/2.0, 200.0))\\n                    lineTo(anchor)\\n                    close()\\n                }\\n                drawer.contour(c)\\n\\n                drawer.defaults()\\n            }\\n\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n'])",
          "('Hello there, long time since my last post here! I was reading a little bit about geometry shaders [here](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Geometry-Shader), and after finding out that there\\'s [support in shadestyle](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/issues/60) for them, I decided to give it a try :) . I tried a simple application, namely transform a LINE primitive type into a pair of triangles forming a rectangle to achieve a \"widened\" line. Here\\'s some little code ```kotlin import org.openrndr.application import org.openrndr.color.ColorRGBa import org.openrndr.draw.DrawPrimitive import org.openrndr.draw.shadeStyle import org.openrndr.draw.vertexBuffer import org.openrndr.draw.vertexFormat import org.openrndr.math.Vector3 fun main() = application { configure { width = 1000 height = 1000 } program { val bufferVertices = vertexBuffer(vertexFormat { position(3) }, 2) bufferVertices.put { write(Vector3(0.0, -200.0, 0.0)) write(Vector3(0.0, 200.0, 0.0)) } extend { drawer.stroke = ColorRGBa.WHITE drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE drawer.shadeStyle = shadeStyle { vertexTransform = \"\"\" x_position += vec3(100.0, 0.0, 0.0) * (2.0 * gl_VertexID - 1.0); \"\"\".trimIndent() geometryPreamble =\"\"\" layout (lines) in; layout (triangle_strip, max_vertices = 4) out; \"\"\".trimIndent() geometryTransform = \"\"\" vec3 a = vec3(gl_in[0].gl_Position); vec3 b = vec3(gl_in[1].gl_Position); vec3 n = normalize(b - a); vec3 o = vec2(n.y, -n.x, 0.0); gl_Position = vec4(a + o * 100.0, 0.0); EmitVertex(); gl_Position = vec4(a - o * 100.0, 0.0); EmitVertex(); gl_Position = vec4(b + o * 100.0, 0.0); EmitVertex(); gl_Position = vec4(b - o * 100.0, 0.0); EmitVertex(); EndPrimitive(); \"\"\".trimIndent() fragmentTransform = \"\"\" x_fill.rgb = vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0); \"\"\".trimIndent() } drawer.translate(drawer.bounds.center) drawer.vertexBuffer(bufferVertices, DrawPrimitive.LINES) } } } ``` If you run the code, you\\'ll notice that while the vertex and fragment shaders are correctly run, the geometry shader seems not to be called. To check this, just remove one of those precious semi-columns in the `geometryTransform` string, and you\\'ll see that the code still runs with no error, making me think the string is indeed not added to the graphic pipeline. I have the feeling that `drawer.vertexBuffer` might not be the right place to use a geometry shader, but I couldn\\'t figure it out from the source code.

The program creates a vertex buffer for 1000 vertices. Then, on every animation frame, we call a compute shader multiple times to populate the buffer, then draw it in 2D. To avoid the compute shader generating always the same result I pass a `vec2` uniform containing the time. A shade style is used to modulate the color along the triangle strip. I [ab]use the vertex color alpha property to encode an increasing value. I could have used a float, but I was planning to generate colors for the strips as well. In the current iteration the colors come from a generated palette in which the hue shifts 360 degrees. Notice that the compute shader runs in parallel, and each produced vertex depends only on its index (and the uniform). If you wanted a vertex to depend on the previous vertex then it couldn\\'t be calculated in parallel. Feel free to ask questions.

The goal was to create an extruded 3D shape and apply a texture to the front while giving a flat color to the sides. Normally one could assign uv texture coordinates to all the vertices (basically mapping each vertex to a position in a texture) when creating the mesh, but in this case I only observed the *normal* and if it\\'s z component is 0, I knew the corresponding vertex belonged to the sides of the shape. If you visualize the normals of the shape in your head, you will see that one flat side has `va_normal.z = 1.0`, the other side has `va_normal.z = -1.0`, and the curved side has `va_normal.z = 0.0`.

          "(\"Terve Eino! :slight_smile: And welcome to the forum :) There are several ways to do that. Maybe the easiest is to use orx-no-clear which allows you to draw and keep the previous content visible. That way you only draw one circle. https://github.com/openrndr/orx/tree/master/orx-no-clear Or create your own [RenderTarget](https://guide.openrndr.org/advancedDrawing/renderTargets.html) instead (that's what orx-no-clear does for you behind the scenes). If you want to draw an animated morphing variable thickness line you could take this different approach, but it's a bit more convoluted: https://openrndr.discourse.group/t/drawing-per-vertex-colored-meshes-and-variable-thickness-lines/266/2?u=abe I'll create an easy to use function and post it as a reply later. ps. Feel free to share an image of what you are trying to create (here in the forum or somewhere else like https://imgur.com/ if you can't yet share images here): maybe a different approach comes to mind when I see it.

In other words, the geometry shader receives a triangle primitive, and produces a line strip primitive, with varying colors of the vertices. Notice the the position transformation is now delegated to the geometry shader: this is due to the fact that the color should stick to the vertex itself, and not to its view coordinates, otherwise when rotating the cube the color \"would not follow\". Maybe I could add to the guide something about geometry shaders and their usage...

[Processing\\'s SVG package](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/svg/index.html) had a way to do this easily. According to their documentation: > To create vectors from 3D data, use the beginRaw() and endRaw() commands. These commands will grab the shape data just before it is rendered to the screen. At this stage, your entire scene is nothing but a long list of lines and triangles. This means that a shape created with sphere() method will be made up of hundreds of triangles, rather than a single object. > > When using beginRaw() and endRaw(), it\\'s possible to write to either a 2D or 3D renderer. For instance, beginRaw() with the SVG library will write the geometry as flattened triangles and lines. It doesn\\'t seem like this is currently implemented by OPENRNDR, but if I wanted to get this \"shape data just before it\\'s rendered to the screen\", where would I look? My fallback approach to the above is to do this flattening in a more manual way using the drawer\\'s transformation matrices, but that seems like it\\'s going to be a lot less optimized and less flexible.', [])",

If the function is for example `{ seconds / 5.0 }` then it plays 5 time slower. In this example I modulated the speed using a sine wave. I tried setting `videoFrameQueueSize = 500` to keep all frames in memory, not sure if that worked. But I do not see any big hiccups when jumping from end to start.

Then this nicely jitters the video quite reliably. I don't see any pauses. ```kotlin video.play() extend { video.draw(drawer) if (frameCount % 5 == 0) { video.seek(seconds.toInt().toDouble()) } } ``` and this provides random pauses in the video ```kotlin video.play() var pauseFrameCount = 0 extend { video.draw(drawer) if(frameCount == pauseFrameCount) { if(Random.bool()) video.pause() } if (frameCount % 60 == 0) { video.resume() video.seek(Random.double0(video.duration)) pauseFrameCount = frameCount + 1 } } ``` If you share a minimal example showing the issue (including media) I can try it. ps.
